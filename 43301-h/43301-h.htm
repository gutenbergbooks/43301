<p>O, my boy! do you wish to make a dollar?"</p>

<p>"I do, sir&mdash;indeed I do."</p>

<p>"What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Will, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, Will, can you keep your mouth shut?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Can you be blind, if need be?"</p>

<p>"You mean not to see anything that is not intended for me to see,
sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I understand, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, it is important that this letter reaches a friend of mine, as I
cannot go myself, so you take it to the number; can you read?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, take it to the number on the envelope, and ring the bell
sharply <i>three</i> times; then ask for Jerry, the Night Hawk; will you
remember the name?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;Jerry, the Night Hawk."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's it; and you must give him the letter in person."</p>

<p>"Suppose he is not there, sir?"</p>

<p>"Then find out when he will be, and keep the letter for him; and
see, I write on the back here for him to give you a couple of dollars,
after which go your way, and forget all about what you have done."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir;" and the boy took the note and turned to depart to the
address on the envelope, when he was called back, while the man
stood in silent thought.</p>

<p>He was a gentlemanly looking person, with a face, however
stamped with dissipation.</p>

<p>In the neighbourhood where he had met the boy, he appeared to be
out of place.</p>

<p>For half a moment he stood, gazing at the face of the youngster,
and then he said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>"My boy, do you remember to have seen me before?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; and yet it seems as if I had."</p>

<p>"It so seems to me, and your face comes to me like a dream of the
past which I cannot recall; but&mdash;never mind; go and do as I have
told you, and you will get your pay," and the man walked on down
the street; but before he had gone far he sprang into a hack, which
had evidently been waiting for him, and was driven away.</p>

<p>The boy thus intrusted with what was evidently an important
note, was an urchin of twelve; but he looked older, and there was
that in his bright, handsome face which denoted both courage of a
high order and intelligence beyond his years.</p>

<p>He was poorly, very poorly clad, but his clothing was clean, and he
evidently took pride in appearing at his best.</p>

<p>The locality he was in was a hard one, one of the worst localities
in the city of New York, and rude, rough characters&mdash;men, women
and children&mdash;were in the streets.</p>

<p>But the lad went on his way without noticing any one, and, as though
acquainted with his surroundings, turned into a wretched street that
was little more than an alleyway.</p>

<p>He stopped at a certain number and seized the bell knob, which
appeared to belong to a bygone age, and in fact the house was a
quaint old structure that had long been the abode of poverty.</p>

<p>His three sharp rings, as he had been directed to give, were answered
by the door opening, seemingly without human agency, while a gruff
voice demanded:</p>

<p>"Well, step inside and tell me what you want?"</p>

<p>The messenger stepped into a small hallway, and saw before him,
a few feet distant, another door, while, through an open panel in it
peered a man's face.</p>

<p>"I wish to see Jerry, the Night Hawk," explained the youngster.</p>

<p>"What do you want with him?"</p>

<p>"I have a letter for him."</p>

<p>"Give it to me."</p>

<p>"No, sir, for I have orders from my boss to give it only to Jerry."</p>

<p>"All right, you can go up and see him, top floor, right hand side
front room," was the reply, and as the man spoke the other door closed
behind the boy, the one in his front opened, and he found he was
in a hallway, into which no doors opened, except the one
through which he had passed, and in the rear was only a pair of stairs
occupying the entire width of the narrow passageway.</p>

<p>A dim light came from above somewhere, and the messenger
ascended the stairs to the second floor, where he saw doors upon either
side.</p>

<p>Ascending to the third floor, he sought the door to which he had
been directed, and knocked.</p>

<p>No answer came, and he waited a while and again knocked.</p>

<p>Still no answer, and then his eyes fell upon a small knob, which he
pulled and found to be a bell.</p>

<p>Still no response, and the thought came to him to ring it three
times, as he had the bell below stairs.</p>

<p>This he did, and instantly he heard a voice behind him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, youngster, what is it you are after?"</p>

<p>He was startled, and turning saw a man's face at a panel in the
door.</p>

<p>"I wish to see Jerry, the Night Hawk," answered Will, promptly.</p>

<p>"Who sent you?"</p>

<p>"That I will tell him," was the cool reply.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm Jerry, the Night Hawk."</p>

<p>The boy looked incredulous, and the man opened the door, and
called to him to enter.</p>

<p>This he did, and found himself in a hallway that was perfectly
square, and the light came into it from above through a skylight.</p>

<p>There was no door in this hall, except the one by which he had
entered, but the man said:</p>

<p>"Is there an answer?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said the boy, when he had meant to say 'no,' but he did
not correct himself, and instantly the man tapped three times upon
the wooden wall of the hallway.</p>

<p>To the new surprise of the boy one side of it was at once run
upward, revealing a small room, and into this the two stepped, the
man telling the youngster to follow.</p>

<p>In the room was a cot-bed, a table, and a rough-looking individual
stood in one corner, holding a rope in his hand, and which he now let
go, the wooden partition, under which they had passed, immediately
sliding back into place again.</p>

<p>"Now, lad, the letter," said the man who had entered the room
with him.</p>

<p>"Are you Jerry, the Night Hawk?" and the boy looked the man
straight in the eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>The boy took out the letter and handed it to him, and glancing at
the address he broke open the envelope.</p>

<p>What was written within was to the point, and very short, for the
man at once said:</p>

<p>"Yes, you are just the boy we want, as the captain says," and he
gazed into the handsome, fearless young face before him.</p>

<p>"What do you want me for?" asked the lad.</p>

<p>"That you shall soon know, and if you serve us well, you will be
well treated; but if not, then you will have to die, that is all," was
the ominous reply of the man, as he seized the boy by the shoulder
and dragged him through a door into a large room where were
a dozen men, whose scowling faces were turned upon the lad with a
look that was wicked and threatening. As he recalled the words of
Jerry, the Night Hawk, and beheld the wild, evil looking men about
him, the heart of the brave boy shrank with fear, for it needed no
words to tell him that he had been led into some trap from which
there seemed little chance of escape.</p>

</div>
<p>HE scene of my story shifts from the city to the country. A
young man, evidently city bred, was standing beneath the
shelter of a woodman's shanty, while the rain poured in
torrents, and sent little brooks surging like miniature rivers adown
the hillsides.</p>

<p>It was in one of the most beautiful localities of the State of
Maryland, where forest, stream, woodland and vale stretched away
in picturesque attractiveness for miles, and where the broad fields of
well-to-do farmers were filled with the golden grain.</p>

<p>The young man was clad in sporting garb, carried a gun,
which he shielded from the dampness, and at his feet crouched a dog,
while the game-bag hanging on a limb near-by proved the sportsman's
skill.</p>

<p>It was approaching sunset time, and the storm had been raging for
a couple of hours, the rain-fall being so heavy as to deluge the country,
and make foaming torrents of mere rivulets.</p>

<p>"It is clearing now, and I will venture, for I would not like to be
caught in the wood by darkness, as I would have to remain all
night," and the sportsman gazed up anxiously at the clouds, breaking
away in the westward.</p>

<p>He was a man of twenty-six perhaps, and his erect form, elegant
manners and handsome face had won many a girl's heart.</p>

<p>A Philadelphian, and the ideal of society, he had run away from
dissipation and comrades for a few days shooting in Maryland, and
his first day of sport had been checked by the storm.</p>

<p>As the rain ceased falling he threw his game bag over his shoulder
and started out upon his return to the little Cross-Roads Inn where
he was stopping.</p>

<p>He had to pick his way carefully, and often, as it was, he went into
water nearly up to the top of his boots.</p>

<p>At last he came to a rustic bridge, across a brook; but the brook
was now surging beyond its banks, and driving furiously along.</p>

<p>"Ho, don't cross there!" cried a voice from the other side.</p>

<p>But the hunter heeded not the warning and sprang upon the bridge.</p>

<p>It was tottering, for its foundations had become undermined; but
he hastened on; it trembled, swerved, rocked, and he sprang quickly
toward the other shore, but too late, as before and behind him the
spans were torn away, and the centre one, upon which he stood must
go next.</p>

<p>"Ah! I cannot swim, and am lost!" he cried, in a tone of horror.</p>

<p>"I will save you," shouted the same voice from the shore.</p>

<p>Then followed the words: "Throw your gun and game-bag away,
and spring clear of the wreck when I call to you."</p>

<p>The hunter tossed his fine gun and game-bag from him and nerved
himself for the ordeal.</p>

<p>He saw the one who had called to him&mdash;a tall, fearless-faced young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
man&mdash;throw aside his coat and hat and plunge into the whirling
waters, some distance above the bridge.</p>

<p>As he came sweeping down the bold swimmer called out:</p>

<p>"Now <i>jump</i>!"</p>

<p>The hunter obeyed, and sank beneath the foaming current; but,
as he arose, his arm was seized by the swimmer, and at the same
instant the tottering centre of the bridge gave way, and was swept
after them.</p>

<p>"Don't be alarmed, but keep cool, and I'll work toward the bank
with you."</p>

<p>"There, put your hands on my shoulders! That's right, and you
are as serene as a May morn; so all will be well;" and the swimmer
struck out for the bank, and at last caught the bough of an
overhanging tree.</p>

<p>It blistered his hands to hold on; but he did so, and the hunter,
who was perfectly self-possessed, also grasped the tree, and both
clambered up the bank.</p>

<p>"I owe you my life, my man, and you have but to name your price,"
said the sportsman.</p>

<p>"Thank you, stranger, but I am not a professional life-saver, and
money would not have tempted me to have gone to the aid of one who
could not swim."</p>

<p>"But come, I was on my way to Miller Raymond's, and I can make
bold to take you there, as I'm about one of the family, I may say, for
I soon will be."</p>

<p>"The miller will send you over to the inn in his spring waggon, for
I guess you're the city gentleman I heard was stopping there."</p>

<p>The sportsman saw that his bold rescuer, evidently a farmer, was
one who had pride, and merited the treatment of a gentleman.</p>

<p>"I beg pardon for offering you money, but it could never repay the
service, so we'll be friends.</p>

<p>"My name is Schuyler Cluett, and that I appreciate your saving
my life you must know."</p>

<p>The young farmer, for such he was, grasped the outstretched hand,
and said:</p>

<p>"My name is Kent Lomax, and I'm glad you begged my pardon,
for it proves you to be the man I thought you when I saw your pluck
in the water. You were as cool as an icicle. But let us move on, for
we'll get cold staying here."</p>

<p>So on they went along the road bordering the stream, and just at
dark, came in view of an old mill standing upon the bank, the
water-wheel turning furiously, while up on the hillside was a
handsome country house, that had the look of being the abode of one
who enjoyed living.</p>

<p>"Well, Kent, you and your friend have been caught in the storm,
that's certain," said an honest-faced old man, meeting them at the
door.</p>

<p>"We've been caught in the creek, Miller Raymond; and this
is Mr. Schuyler Cluett, a city gentleman, stopping at the Cross-Roads
Inn, for a few days shooting, and I told him you would send him
over."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am glad to meet you, sir; but I guess you'd better stay with us
to-night, for we can rig you out, as well as Kent, and I've got a little
apple brandy that will do you both good."</p>

<p>"I thank you, sir;" and then Schuyler Cluett added: "But let
me say that my modest friend here failed to tell you that he saved my
life, as the bridge went in with me, and I cannot swim a stroke."</p>

<p>"Ah! that is just like Kent; but here is my daughter, and he saved
her life years ago in this same stream, when they were children
together. Ruby, this is Mr. Cluett, whose life Kent has just saved;
but hasten to lay out some of my clothes in the spare rooms, and tell
your mother that we have guests to supper.</p>

<p>"Come, Mr. Cluett, you and Kent need a little internal warming up
after your ducking," and the two young men dashed off a glass of
apple brandy of the miller's own making, and then sought their
respective rooms to change their clothes, for, after his eyes had fallen
upon Ruby Raymond, the young sportsman had decided to remain all
night at the miller's.</p>

<p>He felt that he did not look his best, in a corduroy suit of the
miller's and a broad shirt collar; but he had to make the best of it,
and so descended to the parlour.</p>

<p>Kent was already there, as was Miller Raymond, his wife, and
Ruby, and the young sportsman was introduced, and again told the
story of his rescue by Kent.</p>

<p>Then supper was served, and such a supper Schuyler Cluett had
never sat down to before, he said, and with truth, for Mistress
Raymond was noted for her housekeeping the country over.</p>

<p>During the evening Ruby sang, in a sweet soprano voice, played
the piano with a skill that surprised the city-bred gentleman,
and he found her to be lovely in face and form, with large,
dark-blue eyes, golden hair, and a smile of the most fascinating
sweetness, while her refinement of manner was as much a surprise to
him as were her accomplishments.</p>

<p>Mr. Schuyler Cluett also learned a secret from the miller, and that
was the fact of Ruby's engagement to Kent Lomax.</p>

<p>"Kent is a fine fellow, Mr. Cluett," volunteered the miller, "and we
have known him from boyhood.</p>

<p>"His father married a crossed-grained woman after his first wife's
death, and she made it so warm for the boy he ran away and went to
sea.</p>

<p>"He was gone six years, and returned one day to find his step-mother
dead, so he remained at home, took care of his father until his
death, and now owns the farm, a mile from here, and a good one it
is.</p>

<p>"He and Ruby have loved each other always, and they are to be
married, come Christmas."</p>

<p>Schuyler Cluett went to his room that night, pondering over all he
had heard, and at last he said half aloud:</p>

<p>"That beautiful girl marry that common fellow? <i>Never</i>! she shall
be mine, and <i>I swear it</i>!"</p>

<p>And Schuyler Cluett kept his treacherous oath against the man
who had saved his life, for the very eve of her wedding-day with Kent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
Lomax, Ruby Raymond stole out of her pleasant room, unlocked the
front door, and glided across the lawn to the foot of the hill, where in
a buggy, with a pair of spirited horses, sat a young man awaiting her.</p>

<p>"Come, hasten, Ruby," he said in a low tone.</p>

<p>"Oh, Schuyler, I have given up all for you, my parents, my happy
home, and poor Kent.</p>

<p>"It will break his heart; but then it would have broken my heart
to become his wife loving you as I do."</p>

<p>And away sped the fleet horses, while the night wore on, the dawn
came, Christmas morn, and Mrs. Raymond hastened to her daughter's
room, to wish her only child a happy Christmas, a happy wedding
day.</p>

<p>A shriek that broke from her lips, followed by a heavy fall, brought
the miller to the room.</p>

<p>His wife lay unconscious on the floor, an open letter in her hand.</p>

<p>He read it, and his heart grew cold at the words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Forgive me, mother, father, forgive me; but I could not marry Kent,
as I do not love him, my heart being another's.</p>

<p>"Finding out the secret of my heart, I would not perjure myself by
marrying Kent Lomax, and so I fly to-night with the one whose wife I am
to be.</p>

<p>"Some day, when you feel more kindly toward me, I will come back and
plead for your forgiveness.</p>

<p>"Now good-bye, and Heaven bless you and poor Kent, whom my heart
bleeds for in the sorrow I know he will feel.</p>

</blockquote>

<p style="text-align: right; margin-right: 10em;">
"Your ever loving daughter,
</p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-right: 5em;">
"<span class="smcap">Ruby</span>."<br />
</p>

<p>Loud and stern rang the miller's voice, calling for aid, and one
servant was dispatched for the village doctor, for Mrs. Raymond still
lay in a swoon, and another for Kent Lomax.</p>

<p>They arrived together, and Kent Lomax looked like a corpse as the
miller read his daughter's letter, for the eyes of the deserted lover
were blinded with grief and all seemed blurred before him.</p>

<p>"Miller Raymond," said the doctor softly, as he bent over the form
of the mother.</p>

<p>"Well."</p>

<p>"Nerve yourself for another bitter blow."</p>

<p>"Oh Heaven! another?"</p>

<p>"<i>Your wife is dead</i>," was the low response, and the miller groaned,
as he sank upon his knees by the body of his wife and grasping her
hand buried his face in the pillow by the side of the one who had for
twenty years borne his name, the mother of his child who had struck
the death-blow.</p>

<p>"<i>Dead! dead!</i>" shouted Kent Lomax with wild eyes and writhing
face.</p>

<p>"That man did this deed, for he fascinated poor Ruby, won her
from me, from home, from all, and by the eternal Heaven I will track
him to the death for this!</p>

<p>"I saved his life once, but now I will take away that life; <i>I vow it,
so help me Heaven!</i>"</p>

</div>
<p>HERE was no handsomer bachelor rooms in the city of Philadelphia,
than were those of Schuyler Cluett, the handsome young
gallant and "man about town."</p>

<p>Society said he was very rich, that he had been left a large fortune
by an uncle, and many were the young ladies who sought to win favour
in his eyes.</p>

<p>His rooms consisted of a <i>suite</i> of five, for there was his parlour, combined
with sitting-room, his bed-chamber, a spare one for a belated
guest, a snug little kitchen, that was also used as a breakfast-room, and
a sleeping place for a servant.</p>

<p>All were delightfully furnished, and the young bachelor was wont
to take his breakfast at ten, his <i>valet</i> getting the meals for him, while
his dinners and suppers he always took at the fashionable True Blue
Club, of which he was a popular member.</p>

<p>At a stable near he kept his <i>coupe</i> and riding-horse, with a coachman,
so that he lived in very great comfort; in fact, it amounted to
luxury.</p>

<p>His bills were always promptly paid at the end of the month;
he dressed with elegance, took the best seat at the opera and theatres,
was able to take a run around to Long Branch, Cape May, Newport,
Saratoga and the White Mountains in the summer, and having spare
money always with him to lend a friend an X or a XX, he was rated a
good fellow among the men.</p>

<p>One night, about one, a.m., Schuyler Cluett was preparing to retire,
and a friend who had accompanied him home had been shown to the
spare room, which also opened into the parlour, so that the two talked
as they undressed.</p>

<p>"That deuced valet of mine is always away when I need him most,"
growled the young bachelor.</p>

<p>"Now, here he is off at a ball, and why servants must have balls I
cannot understand, and both you and I, Rayford, are half drunk, and
need him to look after our comfort."</p>

<p>"It's too bad!" sang out Rayford from his room.</p>

<p>"I'd discharge him, Schuyler."</p>

<p>"I will, and I do. I discharge him every day, but I hire him over
again before he gets off, and that spoils him; so I'll discharge him
some time for a week, and it will teach him a lesson&mdash;ah! there he is
now, and I'll have to go out in the hall and let him in, for he's forgotten
his night key," and Schuyler Cluett went to the door to answer
a ring.</p>

<p>As the door opened, he began to berate his valet, as he supposed it
was, but was considerably taken aback at beholding a stranger enter
the hall.</p>

<p>He failed to recognise him at first, but suddenly beheld him in the
full light of the parlour, whither the stranger had strode with the
remark:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish to see you, Mr. Schuyler Cluett."</p>

<p>"Ho, Lomax, my dear fellow, I did not know you; but you look ill
and something has surely happened, for you are as haggard as though
after a long illness," and Schuyler Cluett held out his hand.</p>

<p>"No, Cluett, I do not take the hand of a villain," was the stern
reply of the young farmer.</p>

<p>"By Heaven! are you drunk? What do you mean?" and the eyes
of the young aristocrat flashed, while his friend Rayford, half-dressed,
peered out of his door, startled at the turn affairs had taken.</p>

<p>"I mean, Schuyler Cluett, that you, like a snake that you are,
fascinated poor little Ruby Raymond, she that was to have been my
wife.</p>

<p>"We were happy until <i>you</i> came, and she was all my own; but one
unlucky day I dragged you away from death, and I took you to her
home, and from that moment you began to win her from me.</p>

<p>"I saw it all, I felt it all, for she became unhappy, and she told me
she thought we should be as sister and brother, for she loved me, but
not as a wife should.</p>

<p>"She saw how it hurt me to hear her say so, and so she said she did
not mean it; but she deceived me, for she did mean it, and one week
ago, on the very eve of our wedding-day, you came like a thief in the
night and stole her from me."</p>

<p>"Good Heaven! Lomax, I am not guilty of this, and you wrong me,
indeed you do!" cried Schuyler Cluett, his face the picture of amazement.</p>

<p>Kent Lomax seemed astounded, and asked, sternly:</p>

<p>"Do you deny it?"</p>

<p>"I do. Upon my honour, yes!"</p>

<p>"You deny that you ran off with Ruby Raymond from her father's
house, at twelve o'clock on the night of Christmas Eve?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"<i>You lie in your false throat, man!</i>" shouted the farmer, and at
his words Schuyler Cluett sprang toward him; but quick as a flash,
a pistol met him, the muzzle in his face, while the young farmer said
sternly:</p>

<p>"Back! I did not come here unprepared, and I would kill you, oh!
how gladly!"</p>

<p>"I tell you I am falsely accused; and being unarmed, and knowing
your great strength, I am forced to hear you accuse me and submit to
your insults, Kent Lomax."</p>

<p>"Schuyler Cluett, I know that you are guilty, for I tracked you in
your villainy."</p>

<p>"Yet you find me here in my bachelor rooms, and there is a friend
who is with me, and can vouch for my words."</p>

<p>"I can, indeed, sir, for I know that my friend Cluett has been but
two days absent from the city the week past," and Randal Rayford
stepped out of his room into the parlour, he having hastily dressed as
he saw that a tragedy was threatening.</p>

<p>"Ah! he was two days absent, then?</p>

<p>"They are the two days in which he committed the crime of
kidnapping and murder&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>"Murder? Great Heaven! of what else will you accuse me,
Lomax?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of murder; for when poor Mrs. Raymond read the note left
by Ruby, she fell in a faint, and she never came to herself again, but
died, and four days ago I went to see her buried over in the village
graveyard.</p>

<p>"Then I took your track, Schuyler Cluett, and I found out
where you hired your team of fast horses, and where you drove to
catch the train.</p>

<p>"There you bought two tickets for Baltimore, and I lost trace of
you after I arrived in that city."</p>

<p>"You have tracked some other man, Lomax, for your sweetheart
did not run off with me."</p>

<p>"And I say that I saw the man of whom you hired your horses,
and he described you."</p>

<p>"Other men look like me, Lomax."</p>

<p>"And I saw the station-agent where you took the train for Baltimore,
and he described you, and Ruby, also."</p>

<p>"An accidental resemblance."</p>

<p>"A man met you at that station, to drive the horses back to the
town where you hired them."</p>

<p>"That proves nothing."</p>

<p>"Does this?" and Kent Lomax drew from his pocket a handkerchief.</p>

<p>"That is a lady's handkerchief, I believe," was the cool reply.</p>

<p>"It was left by Ruby Raymond in the waiting-room of the railroad
station, and it <i>bears her name</i>."</p>

<p>"That proves that she did run off with someone; but who, Lomax,
for I am not the guilty one?"</p>

<p>"Does this prove anything?" and the young farmer held up the gold
head of a walking-stick.</p>

<p>Schuyler Cluett again started forward, as though to grasp it; but
the pistol's muzzle once more confronted him, while Kent Lomax
fairly hissed forth the words:</p>

<p>"This I found in the buggy, and there is the stick&mdash;see, it fits!" and
stepping to a corner, he picked up a headless walking-stick of snake-root.</p>

<p>"You will not deny your guilt now, for this gold head bears your
name, and it came off in the buggy, and you doubtless thought you
had dropped it along the road."</p>

<p>"I say that I am <i>not</i> guilty," was the sullen reply.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I say that you are, and I came here to kill you; but I
will not be a coward and shoot down an unarmed man. Yet I will not
allow you to escape, for I intend to right the wrong I believe you
have done poor Ruby, and I have vowed, over the dead body of Mrs.
Raymond, to avenge her death."</p>

<p>"What is your intention, Lomax, for this scene is growing monotonous
to me?"</p>

<p>"My intention is to demand that you meet me face to face, arms in
our hands, and as one gentleman should meet another, though I do
not consider you worthy the name you have dishonoured."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>"By the Lord Harry! but this is too much, and I will meet you
were you the lowest of the low; so name your friend, and Mr. Rayford
here will arrange with him!" hotly said Schuyler Cluett.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> have no friend, but that gentleman will do, and he is all we need.</p>

<p>"I will meet you at sunrise, at any place you may state, for I do
not know this city, and our weapons will be revolvers, the distance
ten paces, that gentleman to give the word to fire, and to keep it up
until one or both are killed."</p>

<p>"That will suit me," was the cool reply, and turning to his friend,
he continued:</p>

<p>"You will act for us, Rayford, in this affair this mad fool has
forced upon me?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, and there is a pretty spot, on the banks of the Schuylkill
river we can select, for I know it well, and I will give this gentleman
written instructions how to reach there.</p>

<p>"At sunrise you say?" and he turned to Kent Lomax.</p>

<p>"Yes, and sooner if it could be so."</p>

<p>"That is soon enough, and here is your directions to reach the spot,"
and he jotted down a few notes upon a paper.</p>

<p>"Thank you; and Schuyler Cluett if you prove yourself a coward
and do not come, I will prove merciless and kill you at sight, as I
would a snake," and Kent Lomax left the rooms.</p>

</div>
<p>NTIL the time for him to seek some means of reaching the spot,
selected for the meeting, that he intended should be fatal to
one of them, Kent Lomax walked the streets of the city,
brooding deeply over his sorrows, and his determination to avenge
Ruby, whom he looked upon with pity rather than anger, and her
mother, whose death had been brought on by the act of Schuyler
Cluett.</p>

<p>At daylight he sought a livery stable, and asked for a horse to ride
out to the rendezvous.</p>

<p>"You can get a horse, sir, but you are unknown to us, and we must
ask a deposit of his value," said the man.</p>

<p>"Ah! that is it, you fear I am a horse-thief; well, hitch a carriage
for me and send a driver, one who knows how to reach this place,"
and he gave the directions where he wished to go.</p>

<p>Soon after he sprang into the vehicle and was driven away at a rapid
pace, and in an hour's time was set down at a lonely spot on the riverbank.</p>

<p>Up the stream some distance he saw another vehicle draw up, and
out of it sprang Schuyler Cluett and Rayford, and he walked hastily
toward them.</p>

<p>"I am glad to see that you are not a coward," said Kent Lomax,
addressing Schuyler Cluett.</p>

<p>"You are all wrong in this, Lomax, much as appearances are against
me," said Cluett.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know I am right, for I have not had my eyes shut the past two
months.</p>

<p>"Are you ready?"</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>"I have brought a pair of weapons belonging to Mr. Cluett, sir, and
you can take your choice," said Rayford, opened a box in which were
a pair of handsome revolvers.</p>

<p>"I have a weapon, sir."</p>

<p>"It is best that they be alike."</p>

<p>"Very well, I will take one of these."</p>

<p>"Take your choice."</p>

<p>Kent Lomax selected one without an instant of hesitation, and
said:</p>

<p>"This will do."</p>

<p>Rayford took the revolver and carefully loaded it, and then took up
the other and did likewise.</p>

<p>Then he paced off ten paces, gave the men the choice of positions
by tossing up a dollar, and Kent Lomax won.</p>

<p>Both took their positions, Schuyler Cluett with a quiet smile of confidence
upon his face, and Kent Lomax calm, cold, but haggard, stern
and determined.</p>

<p>The sun was now up, gilding the tree-tops and causing the dew to
sparkle like diamonds upon the grass.</p>

<p>It was a pretty scene, and yet one that had been selected to be
desecrated by a tragedy.</p>

<p>Each man took his position, revolver in hand, and standing to one
side, Rayford said:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, I am to give the word as follows:</p>

<p>"One, two, three, fire!</p>

<p>"Between the words <i>three</i> and <i>fire</i>, you are to pull trigger, and you
can keep firing until one or the other falls, or you empty your
weapons.</p>

<p>"Now, are you ready?"</p>

<p>Both nodded in the affirmative, and then in a loud voice came the
fatal words:</p>

<p>"<i>One! two! three&mdash;</i>"</p>

<p>There was no need of uttering the word fire, for the revolver of each
flashed at three.</p>

<p>And the result?</p>

<p>Schuyler Cluett staggered backward, his hand to his head, while
Kent Lomax dropped as though a bullet had pierced his brain.</p>

<p>"Shot through the heart," said Rayford coolly, and then turning
to his friend he added:</p>

<p>"I think that should cancel my indebtedness to you, Schuyler."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I put a ball of putty, wrapped with tin-foil, in his pistol, and even
with it he left his mark in the dead centre of your forehead, for it is
bruised; but had it been lead, you would have been a dead man."</p>

<p>"Great Heavens! did you do <i>that</i>?" asked Schuyler Cluett.</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"Rayford, I know not what to say; but as you have saved my life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
I will call the debt square between us; but see, he is not dead, and I
will put him in his carriage and send him to a hospital, for we must
look to our own safety now."</p>

<p>This was done; the body of the wounded, unconscious man was
placed in the carriage that had brought him out, and the driver
ordered to take him to a hospital.</p>

<p>Then the two friends entered their own carriage, and were driven,
by another road, rapidly back to the city.</p>

<p>The next morning the following notice of the affair appeared in the
morning papers:</p>

<blockquote>

<h3>"A MYSTERIOUS DUEL.</h3>

<p>"At dawn yesterday morning a young gentleman evidently from the
country, judging from his dress and appearance, went to Nailor's livery
stable and sought to hire a saddle-horse for a few hours; but, upon the price
of the animal being demanded, as he was an utter stranger to the foreman,
he called for a carriage and driver, and ordered the latter to drive him to a
spot on the Schuylkill river, between the Laurel Hill Cemetery and the
Wissahickon creek, and to lose no time in getting there.</p>

<p>"Upon reaching the spot he left the vehicle, just as another carriage drove
up in the distance, and from it alighted two gentlemen.</p>

<p>"There the stranger walked on and met them, reports his driver, and the
three conversed together for a moment; then two of them threw off their
overcoats, while the third paced off a certain distance and, after loading two
weapons taken from a case, handed them to the duelists.</p>

<p>"Word was then given, the driver supposes&mdash;for he was too far off to hear&mdash;and
the pistols flashed together, one man staggering, as though wounded,
the other falling as though dead.</p>

<p>"The driver was then called, and the one who lay prostrate was raised
and placed in the vehicle which was ordered to drive with all speed to the
Hospital, the others entering the other carriage and driving rapidly off in
another direction.</p>

<p>"Upon being questioned by our reporter, the driver of the stranger said
that the other duelist was a young society man about town, but he did not,
or pretended not to know his name.</p>

<p>"He said the stranger's bullet had wounded him in the head, as he wore
a handkerchief about it, but there was no blood-stain visible.</p>

<p>"The comrade of the alleged society-man was also a young gentleman of
this city, but whom the driver pretended not to know.</p>

<p>"Going to the Hospital our reporter discovered that the stranger
was there.</p>

<p>"He had a watch, chain, seal-ring, and sleeve buttons all of good value,
and a pocket book containing several hundred dollars in bank-bills, but not
a slip of paper, or anything to solve his identity.</p>

<p>"He was shot just over the heart, and the surgeons feared to probe the
wound, which they say will doubtless prove fatal though there is the
slightest chance for his recovery, as he possesses a fine physique and the
appearance of an iron constitution.</p>

<p>"Reporters and detectives are busy trying to solve the mystery, and our
readers will be informed if aught is discovered regarding this strange
affair."</p></blockquote>

</div>
<p>GAIN to the crowded metropolis my story shifts, and to a
part of the grand city where dwell those of the humbler
walks in life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>Here are no brown-stone fronts, no elegant homes, but the imprint
of poverty is upon all.</p>

<p>Long years before the place was a fashionable locality; but the
rapid growth of the city forced the wealthy residents up town, and
into their homes, not then as now, superb structures, palatial in their
fittings, the poorer classes moved, to again give place to those of a
still lower strata of the society that goes to make up the world to be
found in metropolitan life.</p>

<p>In a tenement-flat, on the fourth floor of a dingy-looking building,
a woman sat alone, a piece of embroidery in her hands.</p>

<p>The flat consisted of four rooms, one large one in the front, with a
hall-room adjoining, and the same in the rear.</p>

<p>Those in the front were used as sitting-room and bed-room;
those in the rear, the larger one for a kitchen and dining-room
combined, the smaller for a sleeping-chamber, for there was a cot
in it.</p>

<p>The furniture was very scant, and cheap-looking, there being
nothing more than was actually necessary for use.</p>

<p>But an air of cleanliness was upon all, and the woman who sat
alone in the front room had the appearance of one reared in refinement,
one who had seen better days ere she had come to feel the
pinching of poverty.</p>

<p>She was neatly clad in a black cashmere dress that was a trifle seedy,
and which appeared to have been often brushed.</p>

<p>Her form was slender, very graceful, and her face was beautiful
yet sad, while her large eyes were sunken and inflamed as though
from weeping.</p>

<p>The work she was engaged upon ill accorded with the
rooms and surroundings, for she was embroidering a silk scarf
of a rare and costly pattern, and she kept it folded closely in a
clean towel, excepting the part upon which her slender, skilful fingers
worked.</p>

<p>An easel stood near her with a box of paints and brushes, and a
half-finished painting was before her, a landscape scene, with a cosy
country house, an old mill, a brook, and a valley stretching away in
the distance.</p>

<p>Suddenly her eyes were raised from her work, and rested upon the
canvas.</p>

<p>"Dear, dear old Brookside! how I long to see you once again,
and yet I dare not go, even though I should have to beg my
bread.</p>

<p>"Not one word in all these long, weary, wretched years have I
heard from those whom I love so dearly, and deserted to become the
wife of&mdash;<i>a scoundrel</i>!</p>

<p>"Heaven forgive me that rash act; and forgive me for bringing
sorrow upon my parents and poor Kent; but I was fascinated by that
wretch&mdash;yes, fascinated, as though by a snake, for it was not love I
felt, as now I hate him&mdash;no, no, I should not say that of the dead, of
the father of my children," and she dropped her face in her hands and
burst into tears.</p>

<p>Thirteen years have passed away since the reader last beheld her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
who sits there sobbing like a child, and the once beautiful girl of
eighteen, pretty Ruby Raymond, the miller's daughter, has sadly
changed in all that time.</p>

<p>Almost from the moment that she left her lovely, happy home,
deserting her parents, and flying from the love of honest, brave Kent
Lomax, her miseries had begun; and, too proud to return to dear old
Brookside, though deserted by her husband, whom she afterward had
heard was dead, she struggled on to support herself and her two
children.</p>

<p>Not a word had she heard from her parents, and she would not write
to them, fearing a rebuff.</p>

<p>Not a word had she heard from Kent Lomax, and, after all that
she had done to break his heart, she would not seek his aid in her
distress.</p>

<p>She had sewed, embroidered, and then taken up painting as a means
of support; but her income was small, and she had to live very
humbly.</p>

<p>Her children she sent to the public school, and she clothed them as
well as she could.</p>

<p>"Oh! if I could only get a little money saved up, that, in disguise,
I could go down to Brookside and see them all there, though they
know me not!</p>

<p>"I could leave my children with good hearted Mrs. Lucas, next
door, and be gone but a few days, for I only wish to see the dear
old home, to gaze upon the faces of my parents, to see Kent, and then
come back to my wretchedness and toil; but I feel I could work the
better if I could go.</p>

<p>"Still, I cannot, for it would take nearly fifty dollars to go and
return, and I have but ten saved up, and it would not be right, if I
had the money to spend it thus, for what if I should be taken sick,
what would my little ones do?"</p>

<p>Again she buried her face in her hands and wept, to start suddenly,
hastily drying her eyes, and, as a second knock came at the door, to
call out:</p>

<p>"Come in!"</p>

<p>The door opened and a man entered.</p>

<p>He was a most unprepossessing looking person, one to dread, for he
looked like a tramp in dress, and a scoundrel in his face.</p>

<p>The woman arose quickly, and asked as firmly as she could:</p>

<p>"Well, sir, what do you wish here?"</p>

<p>"I've come on business, missus, so don't go to squealin', fer I doesn't
mean ter harm yer ef yer puts up ther chink as I tells you," was the
reply in a sullen voice.</p>

<p>The woman saw that she was in the man's power, for to scream
would bring no aid, as it would scarcely be heard above the din of the
city.</p>

<p>Her children were at school, and there was no one to call upon.</p>

<p>The face of the man showed his evil heart, and in dread she
said:</p>

<p>"I have but a few dollars in the world, and would you take
<i>that</i>?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>"I would, you bet! fer I needs money, and I'll git it, ef I has ter
make trouble, so out with it."</p>

<p>The poor woman stepped to a little half-desk, half-table, the place
where she kept the few souvenirs of the past, and took therefrom a
silk purse.</p>

<p>Out of this she took the money, eleven dollars in all.</p>

<p>"Let me keep one dollar," she pleaded, adding:</p>

<p>"I need it so much."</p>

<p>"Not a copper cent, missus, so hand it over."</p>

<p>"Here it is, eleven dollars."</p>

<p>"It is not enough, for I need more."</p>

<p>"It is all I have."</p>

<p>"You've got jewellery."</p>

<p>"I've a little, souvenirs of my girlhood."</p>

<p>"Durn yer girlhood! Yer should forgit it; so hand it over."</p>

<p>"I will <i>not</i>!" she said firmly.</p>

<p>"Then I chokes that neck o' yours ontil yer can't preach, and takes
all."</p>

<p>"Mercy you can have all," and she handed out a small box containing
a few trinklets of little intrinsic value, but which she prized most
highly.</p>

<p>"You've got some rings there."</p>

<p>"My wedding ring, and one other."</p>

<p>"They are worth somethin'."</p>

<p>"They are worth a great deal to me, for one tells me of a happy
past, the other of only sorrow."</p>

<p>"One was given by a lover, I guesses, and t'other by your husband."</p>

<p>"You are right."</p>

<p>"Well, I wants 'em."</p>

<p>"No! no! no! You would not take these."</p>

<p>"Come, I hain't no time to lose, for I'm wanted by the perlice, and
to pertect mysel', I'll jist tie you up, and put a bandage on that music-box
o' yourn, so you sha'n't shout when I gets out."</p>

<p>As he spoke he advanced toward her, and with a spring he grasped
her arm, stifling a cry with his huge right hand.</p>

<p>At the same moment he fell like a log upon the floor, struck
down by an iron poker held in the hand of a boy of twelve, who
unseen by the robber or his victim, had glided into the room from the
back chamber, closely followed by a little girl of ten.</p>

<p>With a bound the woman sprang away from the man as he fell, while
she cried in a voice of anguish:</p>

<p>"Oh, Will, my son, you have killed him!"</p>

<p>"I have but protected you, mother," was the reply of the brave boy,
who stood over the prostrate form, the iron, which he had used as a
weapon, still grasped in his hand.</p>

</div>
<p>HE boy who had entered the room and dealt what appeared a
death-blow to the robber, was a handsome little fellow of
twelve, well-grown for his age, with an agile, athletic form, and
a face that would win attention anywhere.</p>

<p>He was poorly clad, yet his clothes were neat, and he had the look
of one who had been reared in refinement, in spite of his humble and
poverty-stamped surroundings.</p>

<p>Behind him, holding in her little hands her own and her brother's
books, for the two had just come from school, was a little, fairy-like
form of ten years.</p>

<p>Her face was bright, sparkling and lovely, with a look of wisdom
and feeling above her years, while her attire was neat, fashionably-made,
though of very cheap material, and there was a certain style
about her that many a millionaire's daughter on Fifth Avenue would
give much to possess.</p>

<p>"My son, you have killed him," repeated the mother, in a tone of
horror.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no, mother, for I did not hit him that hard; I don't think I
did, at least, though I was very angry at seeing him spring at you, and
I am so glad we came.</p>

<p>"We got a half-holiday this afternoon, and came in the back door
to surprise you, when we heard that man talking, and I picked up the
kitchen poker and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, Will, something must be done, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>The words ended in a startled cry, for the man suddenly rose up to
a sitting posture.</p>

<p>But Will was equal to the situation, and raising his poker he cried
out sternly:</p>

<p>"Lie down, sir! quick, or I will kill you!"</p>

<p>The half-dazed wretch saw that the boy held him at his mercy, and
he dropped back again in a recumbent position.</p>

<p>"Run, Pearl, and get a policeman to come!" cried Will, and the
young girl darted away, while the robber started to rise, with the
remark:</p>

<p>"No perlice for me, boy&mdash;Oh!"</p>

<p>Back he fell, as the poker descended upon his head with a force that
again stunned him.</p>

<p>"Oh, Will!" groaned the poor woman.</p>

<p>"I had to do it, mother, or he would have killed us both to get
away, for he's a desperate fellow."</p>

<p>And the fearless boy stood over his prisoner with the air of one who
meant to stand no trifling, and knew very well that he was master of
the situation.</p>

<p>The man soon revived again, but a motion of the poker held over
him, and a stern order, kept him on his back, for he had twice felt
the weight of the boy's blow, and, bleeding from two scalp-wounds
and with aching head, he concluded to remain quiet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>It seemed an age to the mother and son that Pearl was gone; but
she had fairly flown to the nearest police station, and came dashing
into the room breathlessly, crying:</p>

<p>"They are coming!"</p>

<p>Again the man moved uneasily, but the boy said sternly:</p>

<p>"Don't make me hit you again; but I will if you don't keep quiet."</p>

<p>"I'll even up on yer some day, boy, if I go to prison for ten years!"
growled the man; and as he spoke, there came steps upon the stairs
without, and a sergeant and two policemen entered, as Pearl threw
open the door.</p>

<p>The sergeant bowed politely, for the appearance of the lady commanded
respect, and he said:</p>

<p>"Well done, my little man&mdash;ha! it is you is it, Black Brick?" and
he turned his attention to the prisoner, who already was in irons, as
the two officers had lost no time in getting the handcuffs upon him
and placing him upon his feet.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's me, Sergeant Daly, and you put a cool thousand in your
pocket by my capture," was the sullen reply, and then he added:</p>

<p>"I s'pose you won't share it with me fer givin' myself up?"</p>

<p>"My boy, this fellow you have caught is an escaped convict, and
there's a thousand dollars' reward offered for his capture, which you
can get by making an application for it."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir, but neither my son or myself would accept money
thus earned, poor as we are," said the lady quickly.</p>

<p>"You know best, madam," said the surprised sergeant, while the
two officers also looked amazed.</p>

<p>"What is your name, my lad?" asked Sergeant Daly, taking out a
note-book.</p>

<p>"Will Raymond, sir."</p>

<p>"And your name, madam, in full, please?" and the sergeant
turned to the mother.</p>

<p>She choked up at the question, her face flashed and then paled;
but after an effort at self-control she responded:</p>

<p>"My name was Ruby Raymond, and since my husband's death I
retain the name for my children.</p>

<p>"Is it necessary that I should give another?"</p>

<p>"No madam, the name of Raymond will do; but you will not surely
refuse the reward allowed for the capture of that rascal there!"</p>

<p>"I cannot allow my son to accept it, sir."</p>

<p>"Pardon me if I say I believe you need the money."</p>

<p>"I need it, sir, true; but not blood money, for I could not look
upon it in any other way."</p>

<p>The sergeant bowed, gave a hasty glance about the rooms, and said
to Will:</p>

<p>"Come and see me, my boy, and should you need a friend at any
time call on me," and the sergeant followed his men and their
prisoner, after bowing politely to Mrs. Raymond.</p>

<p>As the door closed behind the officer, Mrs. Raymond sprang
toward her son, and throwing her arms about him, she cried
earnestly:</p>

<p>"Oh, Willie, my noble boy, you have saved me more than you can ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
know, for poor as I am I would not take a fortune for this ring," and
she held up a solid gold band before his eyes; <i>but it was not her wedding
ring</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII_The_Lost_Gold_Piece" id="CHAPTER_VII_The_Lost_Gold_Piece">CHAPTER VII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Lost Gold Piece.</span></a></h2>

<a href="images/i08large.jpg"><img src="images/i08.jpg" width="44" height="70" alt="S" /></a>
</div>
<p>EVERAL months have passed away since the daring attempt of
the escaped convict to rob Mrs. Raymond in her humble home,
and a change has come that has brought gloom upon the mother
and her two children.</p>

<p>It may have been the shock she had, when threatened by the intruder,
that caused her to break down and take to her bed ill; but
certain it is that she was forced to give up her work, she said for a
day or two, and keep her children home from school.</p>

<p>Little Pearl was a good cook, however, and Will made the fires and
did what little marketing there was, so that their mother did not suffer
for want of attention.</p>

<p>Still she fretted, and a fever followed, and Will went after a doctor
on his own responsibility, and placed his mother in his care.</p>

<p>The man of medicine made three visits, and his pay took two-thirds
of the little money the poor woman had, and she determined to get up
and go to work to earn more.</p>

<p>But she could do but little, and, weak and wretched, she gained
strength very slowly.</p>

<p>Then Will went out to see what he could get to do, and each night
he came in with a few pence, earned by blacking boots, running
errands or selling papers, and this helped to eke out a subsistence for
all three.</p>

<p>Mrs. Raymond did not seem to suffer pain, she had no fever, but her
ailment appeared to be heart trouble, and night after night she lay
awake brooding over her sorrows.</p>

<p>Surprised, as the days passed, that Will seemed to be bringing in
more money each day, she wondered at it, and questioned him, but he
merely said that he picked it up in odd jobs.</p>

<p>"But, Will, you are looking pale and haggard, and you are working
too hard," seeing that he did look wan and white.</p>

<p>"No, mother, I'm all right," he answered, and so the conversation
ended.</p>

<p>But that night Mrs. Raymond could not sleep, and growing strangely
nervous, she went to wake her son to talk to her for awhile.</p>

<p>To her surprise he was not in his little rear room adjoining the
kitchen, and the bed had not been slept in.</p>

<p>She awakened Pearl and asked her about her brother.</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma, don't scold him, for he is at work," said Pearl
anxiously.</p>

<p>"Your brother at work, and at night?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mamma, for he has a place as night messenger in a telegraph
office; he goes on at ten o'clock and gets off at six," explained
Pearl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>"My poor boy! and this accounts for his being so hard to wake up
every morning.</p>

<p>"Yes, mamma; but he sleeps in the daytime when he can, and you
know he goes to bed early, but I always wake him up at half-past
nine o'clock; and, oh, mamma! Will gets six dollars a week, only think
of that."</p>

<p>"And he's killing himself, he don't get half the sleep he should have.</p>

<p>"He must give it up, Pearl, for I will not allow him to ruin his
health and slave his young life away as he is doing."</p>

<p>"But, mamma, you are sick, and Will makes so much, and you ought
not to work."</p>

<p>But Mrs. Raymond was firm in her resolve, and when Will came
creeping into his little room in the early morning, he was astonished
at finding his mother lying in his bed, awaiting him.</p>

<p>In vain he argued; she would not hear of his continuing his night-work,
and so Will Raymond left his place and looked for something
else to do.</p>

<p>But nothing came in his way; times were hard, and but a few pennies
a day were all the mother and her children had to live on.</p>

<p>Will seldom ate at home, saying that he got plenty at the lunch-counters
during the day, and he left the scanty food for his mother
and sister; but this his mother soon began to disbelieve, as the boy
looked really ill and was growing thin.</p>

<p>"To-day is Thanksgiving Day, Will, so we must have a good
dinner," said Mrs. Raymond, with a forced smile, one morning, after
a most meagre breakfast.</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma!" said Will, and his heart was too full to say more.</p>

<p>"My son, I have a gold-piece&mdash;a three-dollar piece given me years
ago, and which I have held on to until now, never counting it in
thinking of my finances; but I wish you to take it and go to some good
market and invest a dollar at least in a good dinner;" and the poor
mother turned away to hide her tears, for the faces of her children
told her plainly that they were hungry&mdash;yes, very hungry, as she was
herself.</p>

<p>Will took the piece of gold, when his mother had taken it from its
hiding-place, and placed it carefully in his pocket.</p>

<p>Then he started out upon his errand.</p>

<p>He was anxious to make his money go as far as possible, and yet
secure the best, so he wended his way to a market, which had often
attracted his attention.</p>

<p>Arriving at the market he feasted his eyes upon bunches of crisp,
white celery, selected some fine sweet-potatoes, picked out a fine
chicken, and then felt in his pocket for his money.</p>

<p>The marketman saw him turn pale as death, and then say, in a
whisper, which he knew was not feigned:</p>

<p>"<i>My gold-piece is gone!</i>"</p>

<p>"Have you lost your money, my little man?" he asked, in a kindly
way.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; and it is all we have in the world.</p>

<p>"Ah! here is a hole in my pocket, and it has rolled out, for it was
a three-dollar gold-piece.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>"But maybe I can find it, sir," and the tears were in the boy's
eyes.</p>

<p>"If you do not come back, I will trust you for your Thanksgiving
dinner, for I know you will pay me when you can."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, sir! You are so kind!" and Will bounded away
to look for his gold-piece.</p>

<p>But then he remembered that if he went at a rapid pace it might
escape his eye; he walked slowly, searching the ground at every step
of the way.</p>

<p>Presently he walked bolt up against a gentleman who had been
watching his approach for half a block.</p>

<p>"Oh, pardon me, sir!" he said.</p>

<p>"Certainly, my boy; but you appear to be searching for something
that you have lost?"</p>

<p>The face of the man was full of kindness, though stern, and his
voice had a sympathetic tone in it that touched the boy, who told his
misfortune to the stranger, adding:</p>

<p>"It was all we had, sir, and poor mother's heart will break, I
know."</p>

<p>The man looked like one who had seen the world, and he dressed as
one who had a plethoric pocket-book.</p>

<p>He was a reader of human nature, and saw that it was no begging
for sympathy that the boy told his story for.</p>

<p>A man of fifty, perhaps, he was well preserved, and yet there was
that in his face that seemed to indicate that his life had not been all
made up of sunshine.</p>

<p>"My boy, I found your gold-piece, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, sir!" cried Will, in delight.</p>

<p>"Yes, and I took it as an omen of good luck, this Thanksgiving
day, and I meant to devote many times its amount to charity, of
which I might not have thought but for my finding this gold-piece.</p>

<p>"No, I cannot give you my 'luck-piece,' as I must keep it; but I
will give you more than its value, so let us go to the market and get
the things you ordered, and then, if you will ask me home with you, I
will go, for somehow I look upon you as a lucky find, my boy.</p>

<p>"Come, now, to the market."</p>

<p>"But, sir, our home is a flat on the top floor of a tenement-house,
and it is so humble, and we are so poor, you would not like to go
there."</p>

<p>"I will go, unless you refuse to take me, my boy."</p>

<p>"No, sir, I could not refuse one who is so kind to me," was the
answer, and Will led the way back to the market.</p>

<p>"Did you find your money, my lad?" asked the man.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, or rather this gentleman found it for me."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, and I wish you to put up your best turkey, and other
things that I will order, and send at once to the address that my young
friend here will give you."</p>

<p>Will stood aghast, as he heard the orders, for flour, tea, coffee,
sugar, hams and other things were on the list until he seemed to
feel that his kind friend was going to provision the flat for a year to
come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, Will, we must take a carriage, for I am a trifle lame, from
the effects of an old wound when I was a soldier in the Mexican war,"
and a passing hack was called, and the two entered it.</p>

<p>Arriving at the tenement-house the gentleman bade the driver wait,
and then he followed Will up the dingy flights of stairs to the top
floor.</p>

<p>Opening the door of the sitting-room, Will ushered his guest
in, and Mrs. Raymond arose from her easy-chair at sight of a
stranger.</p>

<p>She looked pale and thin, but very beautiful, and her face slightly
flushed as she saw her son with the visitor.</p>

<p>"This is my mother, Mr. Ivey, and this, my little sister Pearl.</p>

<p>"Mother, this gentleman has been most kind to me," and Will introduced
his visitor with the ease of one double his years.</p>

<p>The visitor seemed amazed at the lovely woman he beheld before
him, and instinctively he knew that he was in the presence of a
lady.</p>

<p>He bowed low, and advancing held out his hand, while he said:</p>

<p>"You must pardon my intrusion, Mrs. Raymond; but I was so
fortunate this morning as to find a three-dollar gold-piece.</p>

<p>"It caught my eye, as it glittered upon the pavement, and
picking it up I saw that it had a hole in it, so attached it to my watch-chain.</p>

<p>"A moment after I beheld one I recognized as the owner coming in
search of it, and thus I made the acquaintance of your noble boy, and
hence took the occasion to also meet you and his sister."</p>

<p>Mrs. Raymond was touched by the words of the visitor, and there
was that in his face that seemed to impress her, and she said:</p>

<p>"You are very welcome, sir, though ours is but a poor home for
visitors, and I have been an invalid for some little time; but
may I ask, as my son introduced you as Mr. Ivey, if you are not
Colonel Richard Ivey, who was known as Dashing Dick Ivey of the
Dragoons in the Mexican war?"</p>

<p>"Why yes, madam, that was my name, when years ago I was a
cavalry officer; but have we met before that you recognize me?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, but when a girl I kept a scrap-book, and yours was
among the pictures that I took from a paper and put in it, and often
have I looked over the book and your face has but little changed, so
I recalled it upon hearing your name."</p>

<p>"You are very kind, my dear madam, and this is another link of
friendship between us that you should remember me as a soldier, and
I hope you will look upon me from this day as an old friend, one who
knows your sufferings and your needs, for I have heard all from Will,
and I intend to do for you just what I would have done for a sister
of mine were she in distress," and into the hearts of the mother and
her children came a joy that they had not known for many a long day, and
all through Will Raymond's losing his three-dollar gold-piece on
Thanksgiving Day.</p>

</div>
<p>OLONEL DICK IVEY was a bachelor and a man of vast
wealth.</p>

<p>He had been an only son, and the idol of his boyhood life
had been his sister, two years his junior.</p>

<p>Their parents had been wealthy, and they dated their ancestry
back for many generations, and the father of the young Richard had
been anxious to have his son become a soldier, and so got for him a
cadetship at West Point.</p>

<p>A handsome, dashing youth, generous to a fault, Dick Ivey had
won the hearts of professors and comrades alike, and none of
the latter had envied him the first honours of his class when he
had graduated, while the instructors had said they were well won and
deserved.</p>

<p>There were four persons present at the graduating exercises that
Dick was most desirous of pleasing, and these were his parents, his
sister, and her best friend, the young cadet's lady-love.</p>

<p>But, in spite of his honours won, the fickle young lady-love had
flirted with the honoured cadet, refused his proffered love, and
became infatuated, as it were, with a brother cadet of her old lover.</p>

<p>It cut Dick Ivey to the heart, but he nursed his sorrow in silence,
uttered no complaint, and went to the border with his regiment, to
soon win distinction as a daring officer.</p>

<p>The fickle maiden meanwhile married the successful rival, and two
years after died, it was said, of a broken heart.</p>

<p>The news came to Dick Ivey that his sister was to marry, and when
he heard whom it was that was to be her husband, he obtained a furlough
and started for his home to warn her against the man who had
broken the heart of his old lady-love.</p>

<p>But, wounded on the way, in a fight with Indians, he was laid up
for weeks, and arrived too late, for his sister had married the man
whom he now hated with all his soul.</p>

<p>Soon after the Mexican war broke out, and as the American army
crossed the Rio Grande, Dick Ivey met his old rival, and learned of
his sister's death.</p>

<p>Soon after a letter came to him, written by his sister, and given to
some faithful servant to mail.</p>

<p>It told of her sorrows, her sufferings, the cruelties of the man she
had loved, and that she too was dying of a broken heart.</p>

<p>At once did Dick Ivey seek the man who had wrecked the lives of
two whom he had so dearly loved, and what he said was terse, to the
point, and in deadly earnest. It was:</p>

<p>"You know my cause of quarrel with you, sir, and that now is no
time to settle it, for we belong to our country.</p>

<p>"But, the day this war ends, if you and I are alive, you shall meet
me on the field of honour, and but one of us shall ever leave it alive."</p>

<p>And all through the war did Dick Ivey win fame, and he became a
hero in the eyes of his gallant comrades.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>At last the war ended, the City of Mexico was in the hands of
General Scott, and the Daring Dragoons, commanded by Colonel
Ivey, were ordered home.</p>

<p>Instantly, he sought his rival, and reminded him of his words at the
breaking out of hostilities, and the two met in personal combat upon
the duelling field.</p>

<p>It was a duel with swords, and each man meant that it should be to
the death, that no mercy should be shown, and it could end in but one
way&mdash;the death of one, or both.</p>

<p>It was fought through to the bitter end, and Dick Ivey left his
hated enemy dead upon the field.</p>

<p>Resigning his commission, he returned to his home in the State of
Mississippi, and yet he remained there but a short while, for the spirit
of unrest was upon him, and the papers teeming with stories of his
career, he sailed for foreign lands and remained abroad for years.</p>

<p>Again, he returned to America and settled in an elegant bachelor-home
upon a fashionable avenue in New York city, a man of noble
impulses, yet one upon whose life a shadow had fallen, and who
carried in his heart a skeleton of bitter memories.</p>

<p>Such was the man who had found Will Raymond's lost gold-piece,
and his career, from a cadet at West Point, to his living a luxurious
bachelor life in New York, Mrs. Raymond read to her children that
Thanksgiving night after he had left; for the distinguished soldier had
begged an invitation to eat his Thanksgiving turkey that day in the
humble home of the woman he had so strangely met, and who, by
some strange accident, had pasted in her scrap-book his picture, as a
young soldier, and the scraps of his life history as she had then read
them, never dreaming that she would meet the hero with the dark,
handsome face, dressed in his gorgeous Dragoon uniform.</p>

<p>To her children then, that Thanksgiving night, after he had departed,
Mrs. Raymond read the history of the Dashing Dragoon, and
he became to Will and Pearl a hero also in their eyes, and warm was
the welcome that he received when he came the next day to tell Mrs.
Raymond that he had adopted all of them as <i>protegées</i>, and meant to
take them to a pleasant home and send the children to school.</p>

<p>This promise he kept, for he would not be said nay, and Mrs. Raymond,
grown almost happy-faced with the change, moved to a pleasant
little home in the upper part of the city, and Will and Pearl daily
attended the most fashionable schools in the metropolis.</p>

<p>Months thus passed away, Colonel Ivey taking his Sunday dinner
with the mother and her children at first, and then calling oftener and
oftener, until one night he called Will and Pearl to him and told them
that he had asked their mother to become his wife, and that she had
said that she would.</p>

<p>It made them happy, for they were glad to see joy in the face of
their dearly loved mother, and soon after Mrs. Ruby Raymond became
Mrs. Richard Ivey.</p>

<p>It was a quiet wedding in the cosey home, and then into the grand
mansion of Colonel Ivey the mother and her children moved, and
sunshine seemed to brighten all their pathway through life; but alas!
who can see into the future, who can tell how far beyond the sunshine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
lie the shadows that must fall upon our lives, shutting out all brightness,
encircling them with gloom as black as the grave, and far more
cruel.</p>

<p>T was a pleasant night and Mrs. Richard Ivey sat alone in the
handsome library of her elegant country house on the sea-shore,
for it was the summer time.</p>

<p>Her face had lost its look of haunting care, and her cheeks glowed
with health, and she appeared to be happy once more.</p>

<p>Still there were phantoms of the past that would rise before her and
they would not go down at her bidding.</p>

<p>She recalled her first love, noble-hearted, honest Kent Lomax, from
whom she had fled to become the wife of a man who had proved himself
a wretch, a villain.</p>

<p>She recalled her happy home, her loving parents, and wondered if
they had ever forgiven her, for she had not heard one word from them
since her flight, and she knew not the scene that had followed, when
Kent Lomax had met Schuyler Cluett upon the field of honour, and
had fallen before the bullet of the man she had married.</p>

<p>She had told Colonel Ivey all before she had married him, and he
had but loved her the more for her confession and the sorrows she had
known.</p>

<p>He had told her, too, that in the pleasant fall of the year, they
would all go down to Maryland on a visit, and see the old home and
her parents, and ask that she might be forgiven.</p>

<p>As she sat alone in her home she was pondering over the past.</p>

<p>Her husband had gone off on a business trip to the far West, Will
was away upon a yachting cruise, for he had become a skilful and
devoted yachtsman, his step-father having presented him with a beautiful
craft, and Pearl was spending the night with a little playmate who
lived near.</p>

<p>Presently a footfall was heard in the hallway, and Mrs. Ivey supposed
it was the butler, about to close up the house for the night, so
that it did not disturb her, but she started when the words fell upon
her ears:</p>

<p>"<i>Mrs. Ivey</i>, I believe?"</p>

<p>"<i>Oh, Mercy!</i>"</p>

<p>The cry came like a groan of anguish from the lips of the woman,
as she turned and beheld the form of a man standing before her.</p>

<p>He had entered the mansion unseen, had walked into the library
unannounced, and was within a few paces of her.</p>

<p>His appearance was that of a gentleman, and yet one whose life was
a fast one.</p>

<p>He was well dressed, in fact almost flashily attired, wore a diamond
in his front shirt, another upon the little finger of his left hand, and a
heavy watch chain crossed his vest front.</p>

<p>He appeared to be a man of forty, and his face was handsome, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
eyes piercing, yet a certain cold look, added to recklessness and a
cynical smile were not prepossessing.</p>

<p>"You did not expect to see me again, Ruby?" he said in a voice
that was tinged with a sneer.</p>

<p>"I believed you dead," she whispered, for she seemed scarcely able
to articulate.</p>

<p>"Yes, for so I sent you word."</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> sent me word," she said repeating his words.</p>

<p>"Yes, I got a pal of mine to come and see you, and tell you how I
had been smashed up in a railway accident.</p>

<p>"The smash-up was true, and I had my leg broken, and lay for
weeks in agony; but I got well, and here I am."</p>

<p>"Oh why did you do me this cruel wrong?" she groaned.</p>

<p>"To accomplish just what you have done."</p>

<p>"And that is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That, believing me dead you might marry, for I knew your
beauty would turn the head of some old millionaire fool as it has
done."</p>

<p>"And this was your plot?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," and he took a seat near her.</p>

<p>"What is your purpose?" she asked in a voice scarcely audible.</p>

<p>"Not to claim my wife, I assure you."</p>

<p>"I would die before I would again live with you; but it breaks my
heart to feel that I have committed this crime against the noble man
that made me, as he supposed, his wife, for we both felt that you were
dead."</p>

<p>"And wished me so?" he said with a sneer.</p>

<p>"Indeed I did, though Heaven forgive me for telling the truth."</p>

<p>"Well, you see I am by no means a dead man, and as I have no
desire to die of starvation I have come to you."</p>

<p>"To me?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And why?"</p>

<p>"You are rich."</p>

<p>"I am worth nothing, only such as my husband gives me."</p>

<p>"Well, you'll have to strike him for a loan on my account."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I need money."</p>

<p>"I can't help you."</p>

<p>"You must."</p>

<p>"I will not."</p>

<p>"Listen to me, Ruby, and don't be silly.</p>

<p>"You have broken the laws of the land, in marrying Colonel Ivey
when you had a husband living."</p>

<p>"I believed you dead."</p>

<p>"That does not excuse you, and besides, I can bring up witnesses
to swear that you knew me to be alive!"</p>

<p>"Oh, monster!"</p>

<p>"I can do it, and that will prove your guilt, so you see, you are
wholly in my power."</p>

<p>"What do you wish of me?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish, as I said, some money, and I will give you a reasonable
time to get it for me.</p>

<p>"If I get it I will go far away and never appear again to disturb
you; but, if I do not receive it, I will simply make my presence known
to your husband and destroy you."</p>

<p>"It will but drive me again into poverty and wretchedness, for I
will not live a lie to that good man, and shall tell him all."</p>

<p>"You are a fool, Ruby."</p>

<p>"I was a fool when I became your wife.</p>

<p>"I did not love you, though I believed that I did, and I soon
found out that it was but a fascination, such as a serpent has over a
bird.</p>

<p>"I fled from my happy home, I deserted a true, honourable man,
and became your wife, not to be acknowledged as such, for you hid
me away in a little village, while you led a life of dissipation in Philadelphia,
still believed to be a bachelor by your friends.</p>

<p>"In that lonely life I lived, and my children were born, and, with
no friend near, mine was a wretched existence.</p>

<p>"Deserted by you, with my children, I went to New York to earn my
living, and thither you followed me, and I had to give you all that I
had saved up, and you gambled it away.</p>

<p>"Again deserted by you, I sought to hide away where you could
not find me, and I became prosperous, in a small way, by selling the
work of my hands; but again you found me, took my little earnings
and went West, and soon after I heard of your death.</p>

<p>"Believe me, Schuyler Cluett, wicked as it was, I rejoiced that I
was free, for I believed that I was.</p>

<p>"And now you come again, when I felt that my life was not all
shadow, and you demand that I rob my husband to help you."</p>

<p>"I am your husband, Ruby, and I need help, and will have it."</p>

<p>"Not from me, sir."</p>

<p>"Yes, from you."</p>

<p>"I say no!&mdash;for I will tell all, and defy you."</p>

<p>"I will first see him, tell him who I am, and he will pay me to keep
quiet, for the man loves you.</p>

<p>"For the sake of yourself, and of your children, you had best decide
to give me the money, I ask."</p>

<p>She was silent, and lost in deep thought for full a minute, while he
watched her face narrowly.</p>

<p>At last she said:</p>

<p>"Schuyler Cluett, you know that I would give much to have you
never cross my path again; but your coming has unnerved me, and I
am not myself.</p>

<p>"If I give you money, without telling my husband all, it would
but be robbing him to pay you.</p>

<p>"If I tell him, I believe he would pay you as you demand; but yet,
with you alive, and he knowing it, I could not remain here as his wife.</p>

<p>"So go from me, and I will decide when I can collect my thoughts."</p>

<p>"I will give you just one week."</p>

<p>"It is long enough, for I will not need so much time; but do not
come here."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, I will give you an address in the city that will reach me, and
you can appoint a place of meeting when you can give me the money."</p>

<p>"If I decide to do so."</p>

<p>"Oh, no fear about that, for you will decide in my favour, and
for your children for it would be a big scandal, you know, to come
out; that&mdash;but I'll not remind you, so here is my address, and I'll
bid you goodnight, Mrs. Ivey," and he left the room as silently as he
had entered it, and the poor woman was again alone with the phantoms
of the past.</p>

<p>OLONEL RICHARD IVEY came back to his elegant home,
from his trip to the West.</p>

<p>He had telegraphed to have the carriage meet him at the
railway station, but to his surprise it was not there, and so he sprang
into a village hack and drove homeward.</p>

<p>It was dark ere he reached the mansion and his surprise was greater
when he saw no lights to greet him.</p>

<p>"Why Ruby must have gone up to the city; but she wrote nothing
of intending to do so, in her last letter," he said, as he sprang out of
the vehicle and paid the driver.</p>

<p>Ascending to the piazza he rang the bell, and soon a light flashed
within the hallway, and the butler opened the door.</p>

<p>"Well, Richard, what is the matter, that I receive such a bleak
welcome?" he said.</p>

<p>"The madam is away, sir, and has been for some days; but she
left a letter for you, sir, and it's on your table with the mail.</p>

<p>"I'll have lights, sir, at once."</p>

<p>The mansion was soon lighted up, and supper ordered for the master,
who went into his library and took up the numerous letters that had
arrived for him during his absence of several weeks.</p>

<p>All were thrown aside excepting one.</p>

<p>That one bore no stamp or post-mark, and was from his wife.</p>

<p>Hastily he broke the seal, and seeing that it was several pages in
length, he threw himself into his easy-chair beneath the lamp.</p>

<p>As he read, he uttered a sound very like a moan, and, strong man
though he was, his hands trembled as he held the letter.</p>

<p>When he had finished he slowly re-read it, and then bending his
head upon his hands he sat thus, the picture of silent, manly grief.</p>

<p>What he read was as follows:</p>

<div style="float: right; margin-right: 2.5em; font-size: 200%;">

</div>

<div style="text-align: right; float: right; margin-right: 10px;">
"<span class="smcap">Soldier's Rest</span>,<br />
"September 1st, 18&mdash;.
</div>

<blockquote>

<p style="clear: right;">"Dare I, in this letter that I now write you, address you as my heart
would dictate and call you my own dear Richard?&mdash;for such you are to me
and ever will be, though a cruel blow causes me to fly from you.</p>

<p>"The other night I sat alone in your library in your pet chair.</p>

<p>"Will was away in his yacht, on a cruise for a few days, and Pearl was
spending the night with a little girl friend.</p>

<p>"Suddenly a visitor entered the library.</p>

<p>"To my horror, it was one I deemed dead, years ago!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>"But no not dead, alas! but alive, cynical, sneering, cold-hearted, cruel
he stood before me.</p>

<p>"Dressed well, wearing diamonds, yet a begger for gold.</p>

<p>"Need I tell you that it was <i>my husband</i>?</p>

<p>"Need I tell you that he had deceived me in his death, and told me that
he had purposely done so, that I might, by my beauty&mdash;such were his
words&mdash;win a rich husband and then he could force from me gold to keep my
secret?</p>

<p>"Such was his mission to me, and he demanded a large sum that he might
dissipate it in his luxurious life.</p>

<p>"He promised to go from me, and never return if I gave him the sum he
demanded.</p>

<p>"If I refused, he said that he would go to you, and you, for honour's
sake, to save scandal, would buy him off.</p>

<p>"Again, he said he would tell you that I knew he was alive and yet married
you.</p>

<p>"So, in my grief, I begged him to give me time for thought, though I
then knew what my course would be.</p>

<p>"He gave me a week to consider, and, confident that I would yield, he
left.</p>

<p>"He judged me by his own guilty heart and felt safe in his threats to
divulge the secret of his being still alive.</p>

<p>"When he was gone I fell into a swoon upon the floor, and there Richards
found me when he came to put out the lights.</p>

<p>"The maid revived me, and I passed a night of bitter agony; but I was
decided as to what I should do, and I told the servants that I had heard bad
news, and must go away, perhaps to be gone a long time.</p>

<p>"I did not care to say more, that I would never return, for your sake.</p>

<p>"Then I began to get ready, and that day Pearl returned home.</p>

<p>"The next day Will came back from his cruise and I told my children that
we must go.</p>

<p>"I told them that it was no quarrel, no wrong of one of us against the
other, only duty forced me away.</p>

<p>"I had in my purse something over a hundred dollars, which you had
given me for charity, you remember, and I devoted it to charity to myself,
for we go as poor as we came to you otherwise, and it is because I would not
feel right in taking from you one dollar when I know that man lives.</p>

<p>"To-morrow we leave for New York in the early train, and I shall go to
your city mansion and get our old traps there, and place in the Safe Deposit
the jewellery and other valuables you have given to us.</p>

<p>"There is one souvenir I keep, the ring you and I supposed to be <i>our
wedding ring</i>.</p>

<p>"That I shall wear, though the lie stares me in the face; but it was
placed there in honour in so doing.</p>

<p>"Where I go you will not know, for I shall not wish you to find me, which
your heart, I feel, will tempt you to do.</p>

<p>"I go my way as before, to earn our bread by my handiwork, and I am
strong now and in good health, after the happiness that has come into my
life, and I can bear much.</p>

<p>"Heaven bless you, will be my prayer and the prayer of my children,
Richard, for you have been to us all in all, and to give you up is a pang
that cuts deep into the hearts of us all.</p>

<p>"Farewell, Richard, and ever believe in the love, though it be in shackles,
of</p>

"<span class="smcap">Ruby Cluett</span>."
</p>

<p>Such was the letter that Colonel Dick Ivey read, and it was no
wonder that he felt deeply the blow that had fallen upon him.</p>

<p>For a long time he remained in silent grief; and then he raised his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
bowed head, and already suffering had made his stern, handsome face
haggard.</p>

<p>"She is as pure as an angel, and she shall not leave me.</p>

<p>"I will find her, cost what it may, and to-morrow I will go to the
city, and set the wheels of the Secret Service in motion to find her
and her children.</p>

<p>"Then she shall get a divorce from this wretch, for, innocent thing
that she is, she does not know that she can readily do so, under the
plea of desertion.</p>

<p>"If not, why, I'll have to make a widow of her and then marry
her;" and the face of the colonel proved that he meant what he said,
while, after a moment, he added:</p>

<p>"It strikes me that a man who has been such a wretch as this fellow
is, has done that which would place him behind prison bars, and
perhaps stretch his neck, so I'll put the detectives upon his track, and
see what they can discover of his past career;" and with this determination
Colonel Ivey sought the supper room, now cheered with the
thought that his separation from those he loved was but temporary.</p>

<p>CHUYLER CLUETT waited patiently for the time allowed his
wife, in which to write to him, to pass, and no letter came.</p>

<p>What could it mean? Had she lost his address? Did she
intend to defy him?</p>

<p>These questions chased each other through his mind over and over
again, and he could find no answer.</p>

<p>But he waited another day beyond the allotted time, and then determined
to solve the mystery.</p>

<p>To do this he would go to the house of Colonel Ivey.</p>

<p>He first sought the residence of the colonel in the city, and found
it closed up.</p>

<p>This proved that the family had not returned to town.</p>

<p>So he started for the country, and in due time reached the station
near Soldier's Rest, as the home of the colonel was called.</p>

<p>He took a hack and started for the villa, leaving the vehicle at the
gate, while he advanced on foot, having told the driver to wait for him.</p>

<p>It was a lordly place, a grand mansion, surrounded by spacious,
ornamental grounds on one side, flower gardens in the rear, a lawn in
the front, and a park upon the other side.</p>

<p>The grounds sloped down to the walk, and there were pleasure
boats to invite to a sail or a row.</p>

<p>The view from the piazzas was beautiful in the extreme, and
altogether a more charming country home could not be found than
was Soldier's Rest.</p>

<p>"A place for a gentleman of my taste to live, this," said Schuyler
Cluett, as he walked up the grand path to the mansion.</p>

<p>"By jove! a bright idea strikes me, and I hope I am not too late to
carry it out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let me see: if I should keep in the back-ground, that is, out of
sight, and get rid of this gallant colonel, that is, let him meet with
some accident to cause his death, why my wife would be his heiress,
of course.</p>

<p>"Then I could come in, and after half a year's mourning I could
force her to marry me, for appearances' sake, and I'd have all.</p>

<p>"I was a trifle too fast in appearing as I did, and not thinking of
this little game before.</p>

<p>"Now it may be too late, she may have told the colonel about me,
as she has not appeared, and he may simply back her up in getting a
divorce from me, which she can do.</p>

<p>"Well, here I am, and <i>there he is</i>.</p>

<p>"Now I must put a bold face upon the matter and survey the fort
to see if I can take it."</p>

<p>He had dressed himself up in his best style, and Colonel Ivey, seeing
a well-dressed stranger approaching, arose to meet him.</p>

<p>The colonel had that noon returned from the city, where he could
find no clue to the where abouts of Ruby and her children; but he
had set the best detectives on the track and was hopeful of soon
discovering them.</p>

<p>Bowing to the visitor, the colonel advanced to meet him.</p>

<p>Schuyler Cluett bowed politely and asked:</p>

<p>"Is this the home of Colonel Ivey?"</p>

<p>"It is, sir, and I am Richard Ivey, at your service.</p>

<p>"Be seated, pray, or will you enter the house?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir; my name is Cluett, sir, and I am an old friend of
your wife, and have called to see her, being in the neighbourhood."</p>

<p>"Indeed, sir; I am really glad to meet you, Mr. Cluett, so be seated,
pray, for it is pleasanter here than indoors."</p>

<p>Schuyler Cluett sat down. But he hardly knew what to say.</p>

<p>It seemed evident, from the colonel's manner, he thought, that his
wife had kept her secret, for he did not appear to be known.</p>

<p>"I hope Mrs. Ivey is well, sir?" he volunteered.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, as to that I cannot just say, as she is not at home; but
I hope so."</p>

<p>"Indeed! she is absent then?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, she has gone far away, she and her children, and, as you
are an old friend of hers, I do not mind telling you that it is on
account of a grand scamp whom she once married."</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Cluett; she was infatuated in her girlhood by some
wretch whom she ran off with and married, and soon found him out
to be a worthless vagabond, a gambler and all that was bad.</p>

<p>"He robbed her, deserted her, and sent her word, through a confederate
in guilt, that he had been killed, and so believing him to be
dead, she married me.</p>

<p>"But he turned up during my absence West, tried to get her to rob
me, to pay him off from telling the secret of his still being alive, and
she, too noble to do so, fled from my home, from me, and has gone
far away, while I am left alone."</p>

<p>"But you can find her, sir?" eagerly asked Cluett.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I hope to do so, for, I'll tell you a secret."</p>

<p>"Yes, Colonel Ivey."</p>

<p>"I have the detectives at work, tracking down this rascally husband,
and I have found out enough about him already, to give her a divorce,
by sending him to State's Prison."</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, can you do this?" and Schuyler Cluett turned deadly
pale.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I hope to; and more, for I don't mind telling you, my
dear Mr. Cluett, as you are my wife's friend, but you must keep the
secret, that there was a mysterious murder some time ago, for the
murderer cannot be found.</p>

<p>"But this husband&mdash;I do wish I could recall his name&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Raymond, sir."</p>

<p>"Yes, Raymond, that's the name, thank you.</p>

<p>"Well, he was in the vicinity when this murder was committed
and I think men can be bribed to swear that he was guilty, you know
and I'll give a fortune to buy a jury up, so that he can be hanged,
and&mdash;but why do you rise, sir, for surely you are not going?" and the
colonel looked up with surprise, as Cluett arose as though to depart.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I must go, for I just recall an important case I have to
try, as I am a lawyer, colonel, and your story of your wife's former
husband recalled it to my memory."</p>

<p>"But you will remain my guest, sir, for the night at least, and I'll
go up to the city with you in the morning, as I will have this rascal
arrested at once, and I think the law will make short work of him."</p>

<p>"It should, sir, it should, and I have no doubt it will; but good-by,
Colonel Ivey, good-by, sir," and Schuyler Cluett hastened away from
the mansion, reached his waiting hack, and taking out his watch said:</p>

<p>"Driver you have just twenty minutes to catch the Express up to
the city, and if you do it I'll give you a ten-dollar bill extra."</p>

<p>"I'll do it, sir," replied the driver, and the horses were sent along
the highway at a pace that surprised them, as their usual gait was a
jog.</p>

<p>And looking after the rapidly disappearing vehicle, Colonel Ivey
muttered to himself, as his face wore a grim smile:</p>

<p>"Well, I think I frightened him so that he'll hunt a hiding-place
in the far West, and I only wish I did know that he was deserving of
the penitentiary; but I'll telegraph the detective chief to have men at
the station to meet him and see just where he goes, and what he does,
so as to be prepared for him should he remain in New York," and
entering his library Colonel Ivey wrote a long dispatch to the chief of
the detective service, telling him to have men on the watch for Schuyler
Cluett, giving a full description of the man, and by what train to
expect him.</p>

<p>This message was then sent post-haste to the station-agent to rush
through with all dispatch, and Colonel Ivey felt relieved at having,
as he believed, got rid of Ruby's rascally husband, from whom she
could now easily get a divorce, under the plea of desertion and non-support
for years.</p>

</div>
<p>ET me beg the kind reader, who has followed me through my
story thus far, to recall an important personage who was
left a prisoner in the hands of a band of wicked men who
were evidently hiding from the officers of the law.</p>

<p>In that boy captive the reader has doubtless recognized Will Raymond,
for his mother had not taught him the name of his father,
Schuyler Cluett.</p>

<p>When he had been addressed upon the street by a gentleman, and
sent on an important mission, he had been entrapped, for his face and
age just suited a purpose that was to be carried out through him.</p>

<p>What that purpose was will soon be made known.</p>

<p>The time of Will's capture was some months after the flight of the
mother with her children from the elegant country mansion of Colonel
Richard Ivey.</p>

<p>So well had Mrs. Raymond, as I must now again call her, concealed
herself, that the police and detectives, put upon her track by Colonel
Ivey, had been unable to find her where abouts, and it was believed
that she had left New York for another place.</p>

<p>In an humble home, in a cheaper quarter of the city, the poor
woman had found an abiding-place, for it could not be called a home.</p>

<p>The rooms were but three in number, and not so pleasant as those
where she had lived in poverty before; but they were kept scrupulously
clean, and were not uncomfortable.</p>

<p>As soon as she was fully settled, Mrs. Raymond paid her rent for
six months in advance; then she laid in a store of provisions, and purchasing
painting materials, again began to paint little pictures for sale,
for she had but a small sum left of that which she had brought with
her, and she must begin to earn more, she knew.</p>

<p>But the shock of her husband's return, as though from the grave,
had been a severe one, and she felt that she was by no means as well
as she could wish.</p>

<p>Gradually her nerves failed her, the mainsprings of life, and she
became almost a confirmed invalid, unable to do but little.</p>

<p>Will and Pearl had again began attending the nearest public school,
but, as the spring drew near and Mrs. Raymond's health failed her
more and more, her little daughter had remained at home with her,
while her brave boy had given up his studies to earn what money he
could, and this was but little, hardly enough to give them food, and,
but for Mrs. Raymond having paid the rent, it would not have
been sufficient to meet all demands, moderate as they were.</p>

<p>It was while Will was skirmishing around in search of a stray
penny to earn, that he had struck what had appeared to him a
"bonanza," in the promise of a couple of dollars for delivering a letter
and keeping his mouth shut, at the same time afflicting himself with loss
of memory, as the one who paid him for his alleged services had
demanded that he should.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>When, therefore, Will found himself a prisoner, the reader can well
imagine his feelings.</p>

<p>Brave boy that he was, his first thought was of his sick mother's
distress at his absence, and his second of himself.</p>

<p>It flashed upon him, from the words of Jerry, the Night Hawk, the
secret manner of his gaining admission, the letter which had led him
into a trap, that he was meant for some mysterious purpose of
villainy.</p>

<p>The room in which he found himself had but one door, that by
which he had entered, and the ceiling ran up with the peaked roof, in
which were skylights for light and air.</p>

<p>It was a large room, occupying one side of the house, excepting
where the little ante-chamber, or hall-way was taken off, and about
the sides were baths such as one sees in a steamboat's cabin.</p>

<p>A cupboard was in one end of the room, filled with dishes, and
next to it was a dumb-waiter that came up from the lower depths
somewhere.</p>

<p>On the opposite side a door was opened to what appeared to be
another cupboard, but in which Will saw at a glance a ladder, leading
to an open skylight above.</p>

<p>In the centre of the room was a large table with chairs about it,
and seated in various attitudes about it were a dozen men, who
scowled viciously upon the boy as he was dragged into their presence
by Jerry, the Night Hawk.</p>

<p>But Will, in spite of his perilous position, kept up a brave manner.</p>

<p>"What did ther kid come here for?" asked a man with a scowling
face.</p>

<p>"Captain Cruel sent him, and writes that he'll do for the little job
to play on the Philadelphia man whose son died on our hands, and
thus cut us out o' the reward," said Night Hawk Jerry, who seemed
to be leader of the band of ruffians.</p>

<p>"He looks it sart'in, and I thought it were Billy come ter life ag'in
when I seen his face; but will he do it?"</p>

<p>"He'll have to, Jack, or&mdash;" and the look and action of Night Hawk
Jerry were most significant, and did not escape the eyes of Will Raymond.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

</div>
<p>EFORE more could be said by any of the band, a bell rang over
in the dumb-waiter, and two men at once stepped to the cupboard
and began to place dishes upon the table, preparatory to
having supper.</p>

<p>Will was told to sit down on a chair, and the coming meal, rather
than the boy prisoner, seemed to occupy the thoughts of the rude
gathering. By the time that the table was set, with a plate, knife,
fork, teacup and spoon for each, and a dish of butter and large bowl
of sugar in the centre, a second ring came at the dumb-waiter, and up
from the depths below appeared the supper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>The two men, whose duty it seemed, put the supper on the table,
and it was by no means a repast to be refused, for there was hot
coffee, milk, hot biscuit, steak, potatoes and preserves.</p>

<p>Will was told to "Take a seat youngster, and pitch in, for you don't
know how soon yer rations will be cut short."</p>

<p>He had eaten but a light breakfast, and nothing since, so he obeyed
the injunction with a gusto, winning the admiration of the men at his
pluck in not losing his appetite when his fate hung so in the balance
of uncertainty.</p>

<p>But Will had made up his mind that though he was in a tight place,
he would not despair, but find some way to get out, and the means of
doing so did not worry him until the time came for action.</p>

<p>He had read the papers, and he knew that almost under the eyes of
the police there were bands of evil men who would rob and kill without
mercy to gain gold.</p>

<p>That he had fallen into the hands of some such wicked men he did
not doubt; but he did not despair of working out his own salvation in
some way, when he was assured just what their game was that they
intended to win by playing him as a trump card.</p>

<p>So Will ate his supper with apparent relish, and rising, thanked
them politely and resumed his former seat.</p>

<p>"You've been well raised, boy," said Jerry. "What is your
name?"</p>

<p>"Will Raymond, sir," said the boy, returning to his old name, for
while with the colonel he had taken that of Ivey, at his request.</p>

<p>"What do you do?"</p>

<p>"Anything I can earn money at to support my sick mother and
little sister."</p>

<p>"Well, how would you like to become a rich man's son?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean."</p>

<p>"The captain sent you here because you resembled somebody, didn't
he?"</p>

<p>"He gave me a letter to bring to you, and said you would give me
two dollars for doing the errand."</p>

<p>"Well, that was a bait to get you here; but if you do as I say,
you'll do better by far than make two dollars."</p>

<p>"What must I do?"</p>

<p>"Do you see this photograph?" and he held up a picture before Will
of a small boy, perhaps seven years of age.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"This photograph looks just as you did six years ago, and then your
name was Willie Rossmore. Your home was in Baltimore, or rather
near it, and these are photographs of the place, and a handsome one
it was.</p>

<p>"You went out in the grounds, just here, running away from your
nurse, and two men, passing along the highway in a buggy, took you
with them.</p>

<p>"They carried you far away, treated you well, and took you to a
farm in the West, where one day I found you, and you told me your
story and I immediately recognized you as a boy stolen years ago, and
whose photograph I had often seen published in the papers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your father, Mr. Rossmore, is a very rich man, and he has offered
fifty thousand dollars for your return, and I will get it.</p>

<p>"Now, my boy, I wish you to study these photographs of your old
home, and here is the name of the servants who were at the house
then, and your nurse was an old coloured woman, Auntie Peggy.</p>

<p>"These are the clothes you had on when you were stolen; they
are ragged now, for you wore them a long time, and when you got
others you kept these. You had this ring on your forefinger then,
but you can wear it now on your left hand little finger&mdash;see, it
just fits."</p>

<p>"What has become of the real little boy that was stolen?" asked
Will, quietly.</p>

<p>The men all exchanged peculiar glances with each other, and one
said: "Tell him, Jerry, so that he'll know we won't stand any nonsense."</p>

<p>"Well, he would not behave as we wished him to, and he would
remember too much, and so we dared not take him back to get the
reward, you see."</p>

<p>"And is he dead?"</p>

<p>"You've hit it, he is, for one day he left our camp, as we were
crossing the prairie in Nebraska, not very many miles from Fort
McPherson, and we found him lying under a solitary tree, mighty near
dead from starvation; and he died, and we buried him there, cutting
his name into the tree, as a monument, as any emigrant folks would
who had lost a young one.</p>

<p>"Poor little fellow, he had better have done as you wished, and so
been able to get home."</p>

<p>"Boy, you've got wisdom above your years, and you'll play our
little game for us with a handful of trumps and a card or two up your
sleeve, I can tell you.</p>

<p>"I guess you've been nipped by hunger, and wish a soft thing of it
for life, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And you'll talk our way, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir; only it will be very sad for my poor mother and sister
to lose me."</p>

<p>"No, for you can write them that you had a chance to go West, and
I'll take the letter and some money to them, and you bet we'll keep
them from want and send them lots of things, while if you don't like
it where you go, you can just skip out after you've got together a nice
little sum of money, for we don't care so long as we get the reward
for your return, and you shall have five thousand of that, for I'll
keep you posted where we are, and you can have the money any time
you call for it."</p>

<p>"This looks fair, sir; but I hate to leave my mother and little
sister, though I do want to make money."</p>

<p>"Well, you write your mother a letter, and I'll see that she gets it
to-morrow, and I'll put a cool fifty in it for her, too.</p>

<p>"Now, write your letter, and then study over those photographs,
this list of names, and the lesson I have here for you," and Jerry
handed Will various slips of paper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, lad," he continued, "if you play this game right, you'll get
all I say; but if you play us false, you'll be knifed sure, so just bear
that in mind."</p>

<p>"I don't wish to die, and I'd rather be rich than poor, if I can take
care of my mother and sister, and they don't find out I am deceiving
them."</p>

<p>"They'll never know it, lad, and it was a lucky find the captain
made in you, for you look just what we want, and have got the sense
to play the game through.</p>

<p>"I tell you, though, we had a time with Willie Rossmore, up to his
death three years ago, for we had to travel about with him, hide him,
watch him, and were going to take him to an Indian camp to live for
a year or so to make him forget, when he ran off and died on the
prairie. But you look like him exactly, though you are older by a
year or so, but that don't make any difference. Now there's a pen and
ink, and here's your lesson to study, while we play a game of cards."</p>

<p>Will sat down at a shelf that served as a desk, and began to "study
his lesson," as Night Hawk Jerry had called it.</p>

<p>He wrote a letter to his mother, and at last the men began to turn
in, each one going to his bunk, while the boy was also given one, and
crawling into the berth, appeared to be sound asleep, while the last
man retiring put out the lamp, and only the light from the stars,
twinkling through the skylights, pervaded the large room, and the
sonorous breathing of the sleepers soon showed that, guilty beings
though they were, no twinges of conscience kept them awake.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV_Will_Plays_his_little_Game" id="CHAPTER_XIV_Will_Plays_his_little_Game">CHAPTER XIV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Will Plays his little Game.</span></a></h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 59px;">
<a href="images/i15large.jpg"><img src="images/i15.jpg" width="59" height="70" alt="L" /></a>
</div>
<p>YING in his little bunk, which was an upper one, Will
Raymond did not go to sleep.</p>

<p>He saw the men drop off one by one, from their card playing,
he watched the last one up draw on the ropes, to raise the skylights
and let in more air, and, as he came to the one near him, he feared he
was going to see if he was asleep, so he closed his eyes and breathed
hard.</p>

<p>But the man drew on the rope, that raised the skylight, some
ten feet above Will's head, and then putting out the lamp he went to
bed.</p>

<p>Still gazing upward Will saw the stars fade from view, and the skylights
rattled, showing that the clouds had obscured the sky and a
wind was springing up.</p>

<p>Until all seemed to be asleep, Will lay quiet as a mouse; then he
bent over the edge of his bunk and looked about him.</p>

<p>Raising himself then to a kneeling posture, he saw that the ladder,
before referred to as going up to a skylight, was right by the foot of
his berth.</p>

<p>Softly he arose, grasped one of the rounds and drew himself up.</p>

<p>Without the slightest sound he ascended the ladder, crept up
through the skylight and found himself upon the peak of the high roof.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>Standing up he glanced about him, and his eye fell upon nothing
but roofs.</p>

<p>He saw that the building on which he stood ran back some distance
from the street, was very high, narrow, and ended fifty feet away in a
large chimney.</p>

<p>On each side of the sharp roof were slats, a foot from the top,
evidently placed there to serve as foot guards in a walk toward the
chimney.</p>

<p>The clouds, black as night, were now flying low, and skurrying
along before an approaching storm. The lightning came in vivid
flashes, and it was enough to appall the heart of a seaman, there on
that high perch, where the slightest misstep would hurl him to death,
the tremour of a nerve would dash him to his doom.</p>

<p>But there was death behind him, sure, and a struggle against death
before him, with chances of the boy's triumph, so he held on in his
determination to escape.</p>

<p>He knew that the men had placed those slats along the roof for
some purpose, and that there was a way to escape from the roof he did
not doubt, so he determined to find it.</p>

<p>With the bundle at his back, tied with a string about his waist,
bare-headed, bare-footed, jacketless, the brave boy stood on the
dangerous perch, to return to the outlaw band certain death, to
advance a chance for life, while the lightning fairly blinded him, with
its vividness.</p>

<p>Step by step the boy advanced toward the chimney, for he dared
not tarry there long, as any moment the storm might awaken the
Land Sharks, as Will had heard the band speak of themselves, and, if
missed, he would be pursued and taken.</p>

<p>But he had arranged his bedding so as to look like a form in his
berth, and placed his jacket, shoes and hat so as to be seen, if he was
suspected, which he did not believe.</p>

<p>As he took the first step the rain began to descend in torrents, and
a sound behind him caused him to turn his head quickly.</p>

<p>He saw that the skylights were being lowered by someone in the room
and he breathed more freely as he felt that he had not been discovered.</p>

<p>But the rain driving into his face, blinded him, as he had no hat to
shelter his eyes, and the slats and roof being wet, rendered his position
far more perilous.</p>

<p>But on he went, step by step, until he reached the chimney. It was
breast high to him, and he noticed that it was very large.</p>

<p>From there down to the ground was a long way, and he saw no
means of descending.</p>

<p>Perhaps upon the other side there was a ladder, he thought, and
again it came to his mind that the men might have a rope ladder to
bring with them.</p>

<p>If this was the case he was doomed, and, the thought in spite of
the driving cold rain made him break out into a dense perspiration.</p>

<p>Leaping upon the chimney, for his experience as an amateur sailor
had helped him, and he had often gone on board ships at the wharf
and ascended to the highest point he could reach, he gazed over the
side of the brickwork to see if there was aught to aid his descent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>But he saw that the roof was even with the chimney, so no ladder
could go down it.</p>

<p>"They must hook a rope-ladder into the chimney in some way,"
he muttered, and he ran his hand around inside to find the hook,
determined to tear his clothing in strips and make a rope, so that
he might escape.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he said, as his hand touched a piece of iron.</p>

<p>"<i>A ladder inside</i>," he cried, joyously, as he felt rods of iron going
down as far as he could reach. Instantly he lowered himself into
the chimney and commenced the descent.</p>

<p>Feeling with his feet he found the rods, two feet apart, and down
he went into the gloom.</p>

<p>One thing was certain, the chimney was not used as a smoke-conductor,
for there was no soot in it. Down, down he went into
the darkness, only a shadowy light showing the opening in the top
of the chimney.</p>

<p>He had counted twenty rods, and so knew that he must have
descended some forty feet.</p>

<p>Then his feet touched bottom, and turning, he saw the glimmer of
a light through a crack.</p>

<p>Stooping, he gazed through the crack and looked out into a room
dimly lighted, the gas being turned down low.</p>

<p>He saw that a fire-board hid the open chimney in which he stood,
and moving it out he beheld the interior of the room distinctly.</p>

<p>There were two windows, one on either side of the fire-place, and he
heard the wind rattling the sashes furiously, and the rain pattering
viciously against the panes of glass.</p>

<p>There was a stove before him, but it was evidently there for show,
as the smoke-stack entered the chimney, yet no soot was in it, which
proved that a fire could not have been lighted in it.</p>

<p>A table with books on it, some pictures on the walls, a clothes-press,
and over on one side of a door was a bed, while horrors! <i>there was a
man in it!</i></p>

<p>The occupant of the bed was asleep, that was certain, his face
turned toward the wall, as Will could see by the dimly-burning gas-jet
over the table.</p>

<p>To escape, the boy saw that his only chance was to get out of his
hiding-place, cross the room, unlock the door, and thus get out; but
when out of the room would he be free?</p>

<p>This was the startling question he asked himself, as he grasped the
fireguard to push it one side, determined to at once make the venture,
for he did not know at what moment he might find a pursuer coming
down the chimney on his track.</p>

</div>
<p>HE reader can fully appreciate the peril of Will when they know
what was behind him, and that he had a room, unknown to him,
and with an occupant asleep in it, to cross, before he got out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
while he little knew where the door would lead him, or whether he
would be any nearer escape than where he then was.</p>

<p>Cautiously he raised the fireboard from within and began to move
it outwardly as though it swung on a hinge.</p>

<p>He did this noiselessly, and soon had space enough to get through.</p>

<p>This he did and rose to a standing posture, the little bundle still at
his back.</p>

<p>Then he put the fireboard back in its place and stepped forward.</p>

<p>The floor creaked and startled him, and he walked quickly to the
door.</p>

<p>As he reached it the sleeper started, turned in bed, raised his head,
and glanced toward the window, while he muttered: "What a deuce
of a storm is raging."</p>

<p>Then back dropped his head, and he did not see the boy crouching
down within two feet of him, and who held, grasped firmly and ready
for use, a boot-jack, that his hand accidently touched.</p>

<p>Had the man attempted to get out of bed, or had he glanced toward
the boy, he would have felt the weight of the boot-jack, for Will was
determined to escape at all hazards, even if he had to strike at human
life, for he did not doubt, coming to this room as he had from the den
of the Land Sharks, that the occupant was one of the band.</p>

<p>But, fortunately for the man he dropped off to sleep again, and fortunately,
too, for Will, who might have made a miss blow and then
been killed or captured.</p>

<p>As soon as the heavy breathing of the man indicated that he was
once more asleep, Will turned to the door and placed his hand upon
the key. He turned it slowly in the lock, and yet it creaked loudly to
his ears; but the noise of the storm without drowned the sound as far
as waking the sleeper was concerned.</p>

<p>Taking hold of the knob he drew back the latch, and moved the
door. It creaked loudly, so he shut it to quickly as he saw the man
move uneasily. He kept still, and the man once more breathed naturally
in his slumber.</p>

<p>Drawing the key from the door Will then opened it quickly and
stepped outside, closed it after him, though trembling at the loud
creaking sound it made.</p>

<p>At the same time he thrust the key in the door and turned it, just
as he heard the man spring out of bed.</p>

<p>Where he was he did not know, for all was blackness about him, but
he at once moved away from the door, feeling his way cautiously, while
he could hear the occupant of the room moving hastily about, and
then grasp the knob of the door.</p>

<p>A smothered curse followed the words: "The key is gone!"</p>

<p>Then there was a shaking of the door, and Will nearly fell down a
flight of stairs; but caught himself on the rail.</p>

<p>As he hastily descended there appeared a crescent-shaped light
before him, and he knew that it was over a door, and a moment after
he reached it.</p>

<p>It was locked, but the key was on the inside and hastily he turned
it, and he could hardly restrain a shout of joy as he found himself out
in the street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>The storm was at its height, the rain was pouring in torrents and
the narrow street was flooded; but the daring boy cared little for
that and turning noted the house and number.</p>

<p>Then he darted away, unmindful of the rain.</p>

<p>At the corner he saw the name of the street, and once more pressed
on, seemingly acquainted with the locality and aiming for a certain
point.</p>

<p>Not even a policeman was seen out in that driving rain, so the boy
met no human being as he ran along up to his ankles in water.</p>

<p>Here and there a light burned dimly, evidently in some sick-room,
and all else was darkness, excepting the flickering street-lamps at the
corners. Turning into another street he came in sight of a coloured
lamp, jutting out from a large brick house.</p>

<p>Toward this he ran and a moment after, dripping wet, bare-headed,
shoeless and jacketless he darted into a room where sat several officers
in police uniform, while one wearing the badge of a captain of the
force sat behind a desk in a small adjoining room.</p>

<p>The boy appeared like an apparition to the officers, but he gave
them no time for thought, as he said: "Is not that Sergeant Daly?"
and he pointed to the officer in the other room.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is <i>Captain</i> Daly, for he's been promoted," answered an
officer.</p>

<p>"Ho, Murphy, any one to see me?" called out the captain.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, a boy that looks as if he'd just swum across East river,"
was the reply.</p>

<p>"Ah! I know that face, you are Will Raymond, who captured the
convict for me over a year ago," said Captain Daly coming out.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, and I've come to tell you a strange story, and guide you
to the den of a band of outlaws that call themselves Land Sharks for
I just escaped from them," and Will spoke quickly, though with not
a particle of excitement in his manner and voice, so well did he control
his feelings.</p>

<p>The name of Land Sharks caused the police present to gather near
at once and appear deeply interested, while Captain Daly said:
"If you know the hiding-place of that gang, my lad, you know more
than any policeman or detective in New York has been able to find
out."</p>

<p>"I do know it, sir, and two ways of getting there; but what you
do, you must do now, as they will escape, so I'll tell you all I can
while you get your men ready, and there are over a dozen in the
band."</p>

<p>"Murphy, call up twenty men and a sergeant at once."</p>

<p>"Now, Master Will, for you see I have not forgotten your name, let
me have your story."</p>

<p>In as few words as possible, Will told of his having been stopped by
a well-dressed stranger and then sent to the den of the Land Sharks,
as an excuse to get him into their clutches.</p>

<p>His manner of getting there, and his reception he made known,
together with his acquiescence, as the outlaw supposed, in their plot
to get the reward offered for Willie Rossmore, the little son of the
Baltimore millionaire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>His escape, bringing with him in a bundle, the photographs, and
well-worn clothing the kidnapped boy had on when taken, he also
made known, and they were displayed before the police captain, who
said: "These can wait, and will dry by the time we get back; but
Will, you are a natural born detective, and you shall have work as
such, that will keep your mother and sister from want; but here
are my men, my brave boy, and we will start at once&mdash;ho! I
forgot that you were wet and shivering but I'll soon make you comfortable."</p>

<p>An order to an attendant brought from a package room a thick suit
and india-rubber coat, into which the boy had no difficulty in getting,
as they were nearly double his size, and a policeman's hat sheltered his
head.</p>

<p>Then, side by side with Captain Daly, and with a score of policemen
following, they stepped out into the driving rain to go upon the raid
against the Land Sharks.</p>

</div>
<p>HE first point of destination of the police squad, was to the door
out of which Will had made his escape, and he led the men
directly to it. It was unlocked, as he had left it, but four men
were left there, and the others followed the boy around to another
street, where was the number at which he had entered the den.</p>

<p>"I've made no mistake in this number, but yet it don't look like the
place," he said as he stopped before the door.</p>

<p>"I hope you have made no mistake, my lad," anxiously said
Captain Daly.</p>

<p>"I know I have not, sir; but then I can't find the bell."</p>

<p>In vain he searched, there was no bell at the side, but instead a
large old-fashioned knocker.</p>

<p>"This is a white door, sir, as you see, and the other was painted
brown."</p>

<p>"Then you are certainly mistaken, my lad."</p>

<p>"No, sir, I am not mistaken, for this is the number, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what?" asked Captain Daly, as Will paused.</p>

<p>"They have taken out the bell from the side, sir, and <i>changed the
door, since I left</i>."</p>

<p>Several of the policemen laughed, but Captain Daly did not, and
said: "If you say so, Will, I'll believe you.</p>

<p>"Your dark lantern here, Gibson."</p>

<p>The man addressed handed over his lantern, and Will ran the light
up and down the door-post.</p>

<p>"Here's where the bell-knob was, sir, and it's been plugged up as
you see, by something that fits in."</p>

<p>"You are right, Will," and the captain gave the knocker three
sharp blows.</p>

<p>But no response came, and Will said: "They'll not answer, sir,
for they've changed this door to fool me, and they know I've escaped
from that man I locked in his room."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right, we'll open the door ourselves.</p>

<p>"In with it, men!"</p>

<p>Half a dozen policemen threw themselves against the door; but it
withstood their weight, and the locks within only yielded after
repeated trials. Then the door flew open, and all entered the hallway,
closing it behind them.</p>

<p>The next door then confronted them, but Will pointed out the
panel, and a club smashed that in, when Captain Daly put in his
hand and drew back the bolt.</p>

<p>"This is a secure nest, that is certain; but I fear we'll find it
deserted," said Captain Daly, and with their lantern-shades raised,
they hastily followed Will up the stairs.</p>

<p>He went directly to the door by which he had entered, and the
panel was opened with a club, and the officers dashed in, and throwing
themselves against the inner door it yielded to their weight with a
crash.</p>

<p>Then they found themselves in the large living room of the band,
from whence Will had made his escape.</p>

<p>The bunks were there, the table, chairs, dumb-waiter, and much
clothing and bedding was scattered about, showing a hasty
departure; but not a soul was present.</p>

<p>"Will you follow down the chimney, sir?" asked Will.</p>

<p>"Yes, I will follow with several of my men, while the remainder
break in every door of this nest, which is, indeed, a safe retreat.</p>

<p>"Come, men, I want only those who have cool heads on lofty
places to go, for, from what he told me, it will require all your nerve
to follow him."</p>

<p>Four of the officers volunteered, and up the ladder went Will, he
having in the meantime recovered his hat, shoes and jacket from the
floor.</p>

<p>Out upon the roof, in the drenching rain, the boy stepped, and
made his way fearlessly along the dizzy hight, followed by Captain
Daly and his men, who stepped with the greatest caution, for they
realised their deadly peril at a glance.</p>

<p>Fearlessly the brave boy led the police captain and his men, the
chief calling out: "Go slow, Will, for a false step here will send us
to perdition!"</p>

<p>Reaching the chimney, Will sprang upon the top and disappeared
in the interior, the others following, and descending the iron ladder
in silence.</p>

<p>Down to the fire-place went Will, and the instant after Captain
Daly joined him, and handing the boy his dark-lantern to spring
open, the two hastily sprang out into the room.</p>

<p>It was deserted, but the door was partly open, for the lock had
been wrenched off.</p>

<p>The pictures were on the wall, the bed all rumpled up, and the
lamp was upon the table, while there was every indication of a hasty
departure, as in the assembly room.</p>

<p>Then the police went on a voyage of discovery through the house.</p>

<p>It was an old-time mansion, two stories, narrow in build, and ran
back against the one on the other street, to which the false chimney<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
belonged, and in it were some half-score of poor, but reputable
lodgers, who, aroused by the police, were amazed at the raid upon
them.</p>

<p>In answer to inquiries, they said that the room on the rear, through
which the officers had come, was occupied by an artist, they had heard,
though no one seemed to know much about him except that he had
a number of visitors.</p>

<p>That there was a secret connected with his living there they had not
suspected.</p>

<p>Confident that the lodgers of the house told the truth, Captain Daly
left two of his men on duty there, and started around the block to the
other house.</p>

<p>He found the party still on guard at the door, and they had not
seen or heard anything of a suspicious nature.</p>

<p>Going around to the other house Captain Daly found that his men
had thoroughly searched the place from the cellar to the attic.</p>

<p>They had discovered the door which Will had remembered to have
seen in front, and as it was still dripping wet it showed that it had
been removed that night from its place, to throw the boy off his guard,
but it had, however, failed to do so.</p>

<p>In different rooms of the house was found a quantity of stolen
booty, the loss of some of which Captain Daly and his men
had heard of, and there was every indication that it was a nest of
burglars of a daring and desperate nature.</p>

<p>The Land Sharks had long been known to the police for their
bold acts of crime, yet they never before could be located, and
even the gruffest of the policemen praised Will for what he had
done.</p>

<p>Dawn was now breaking, and a neighbour, coming out of his
house, was asked who owned the premises.</p>

<p>He said that his landlord did so, and giving the address, the
proprietor of the two houses was at once looked up; but he was
amazed at what he heard, for he let the property to an old
woman who said she wished to keep boarders, and had regularly
paid her rent three months in advance, and had built a new chimney
and made other improvements which she had paid for herself.</p>

<p>The landlord was greatly amazed to find what those improvements
were, but he could give no clue as to who or what his tenant was,
or where she could be found.</p>

<p>Having discovered the secret retreat of the Land Sharks, however,
was a cause of congratulation, and the booty found was
considerable, so that Will was praised for his good services, and at
once told that he was to consider himself a member of the Secret
Service and to report the following day after he had become rested,
for the night of peril and hardship the good-hearted police-captain
could see had told on the brave boy.</p>

<p>With a heart bounding with joy, Will had hastened home, and
his mother and sister greeted him warmly, for they were most
anxious regarding his long absence, and with wonder they listened
to the strange story of his adventures, while Pearl cried in glee:
"Hurrah for the Boy Detective!"</p>

</div>
<p>HE day and night of rest which Will took, he really needed, for
his capture, escape and hard work, had indeed been a severe
strain upon him.</p>

<p>Captain Daly had picked up a roll of bills, in the Land Sharks'
rooms which some one of them had dropped in their haste to get away,
and he had insisted upon Will's falling heir to the money, though the
boy had urged against it.</p>

<p>There were only about twenty dollars, but it was a large sum to
Will, and he handed it over to his mother, so that when he awoke
from his long sleep, he found a splendid dinner ready, for Pearl
had been to the market and spent the five-dollar bill given her
with no economical hand. The mother and her children greatly
enjoyed their dinner, and Will then told his mother that Captain
Daly had said that his pay would be thirty dollars a month to
begin with, and all felt cheered at the prospect, and retired with
lighter hearts than they had had the past few weeks.</p>

<p>Upon reporting at the office of Captain Daly the next morning,
Will received a warm welcome from all, and was congratulated over
and over again upon his nerve and the good services he had rendered.</p>

<p>"Now, Will," the captain said, "I find that Mr. Rossmore, a
retired merchant of Baltimore, lost a son Willie some six years ago,
and still offers large rewards for his restoration.</p>

<p>"From what you heard from the Land Sharks, you know more
than any one else about the matter, and the boy is doubtless dead, as
they stated, and they evidently murdered him.</p>

<p>"Now I wish you to go to Baltimore with these clothes, the photographs
and the ring, and see Mr. Rossmore, telling him all, and
directing him to the spot on the prairie, as well as you can, where your
friend Night Hawk Jerry said the boy was buried.</p>

<p>"Will you go?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir, for I am ready to do just what you wish, if you
think I am able to accomplish it."</p>

<p>"You are able to do a man's work, Will, after what you did to
extricate yourself from the clutches of those Land Sharks.</p>

<p>"Now I will give you the money for your trip, and you had better
get a satchel, a suit of clothes and some other things, and get your
mother to pack them for you.</p>

<p>"Here are twenty-five dollars to fit you out with, and I'll give you
the money for your trip when you are ready to start.</p>

<p>"And here, my boy, I had almost forgotten to give you your badge
of office; it is a gold one, and a present to you by the officers of this
precinct.</p>

<p>"We would make it a public demonstration, only we do not wish it
known outside that we have made a new departure and enlisted a boy
in the Secret Service force."</p>

<p>As Captain Daly spoke, he pinned under the boy's coat a handsome
gold badge, a shield, upon which was engraven:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">"SPECIAL OFFICER<br />
of<br />
<span class="smcap">Metropolitan Secret Service</span>."</p>

<p>"I will prove deserving of all your kindness, Captain Daly,"
said Will, with a choking voice, and he sallied forth to make his
purchases.</p>

<p>This done, he took them home, and Mrs. Raymond packed his little
grip-sack, while Pearl was lost in admiration over the gold badge.</p>

<p>With the shield fastened securely upon his vest, beneath his coat,
and his satchel in his hand, Will bade his mother good-bye and started
for the precinct to get his final orders.</p>

<p>These were given him along with a well-filled purse, and Captain
Daly went with him across the ferry to see him on board the train.</p>

<p>As he took his seat alone in the sleeping car, which the kind-hearted
captain had provided him with, Will felt his own importance,
and his heart was full of gratitude that he had, by his own acts,
become able to earn a support for his mother and sister.</p>

<p>Arriving in Baltimore, he went to the hotel to which Captain Daly
had directed him, and, after breakfast, with the photographs and
clothing of the kidnapped boy wrapped up in a bundle, he made
inquiries as to where the home of Mr. Rossmore was, and set out to
go there.</p>

<p>He found it without much difficulty, a superb country seat in the
outskirts of the city, and he recognized at a glance the scenes of the
photographs he had with him.</p>

<p>A gardener was at work upon a bed of flowers, and approaching
him, Will asked if Mr. Rossmore was at home.</p>

<p>"No, young gentleman, they have gone to their farm for a few
weeks on the eastern shore," was the answer.</p>

<p>At once Will determined to follow them there, and after getting
the directions, he asked: "Has Mr. Rossmore ever heard of his
missing child?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed, not a word, and it's my opinion he never will, as I
think little Willie is dead; but master thinks he'll find him yet; but
Lordy! you hain't Master Willie, are you, for you do look 'mazing
like him."</p>

<p>"My name is Willie, but I am not Mr. Rossmore's son, though
others have said I look like him."</p>

<p>"You do, for a certainty, sir, and master and his wife will see the
likeness, I'm sure, if you are going there."</p>

<p>"Yes, I am going there, for it is important that I should see
them," and bidding the old gardener good-bye, Will returned to the
hotel and discovered that a boat left the next afternoon for the town
nearest the Rossmore farm.</p>

<p>So he went down to the wharf and secured his berth, and amused
himself looking about the city until time to go on board the next
day.</p>

<p>He had a pleasant state-room, and, as he made himself at home in
it, he felt that he was becoming quite a traveller.</p>

<p>Enjoying the run down the Chesapeake, it was late when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
retired, and he dropped off quickly to sleep, lulled by the motion of
the boat.</p>

<p>He was awakened by the hum of voices, and saw a light in his
face, strangely like the glare of a bull's-eye lantern.</p>

<p>But he had at once saw that it came through a knot-hole in the
partition between his and the next state-room, and within a few feet
of him were two men, one lying in the berth, the other seated upon a
chair, and they were talking in a low tone.</p>

<p>Without stopping up his ears, Will could not help hearing all they
said, and the voice of one seemed familiar.</p>

<p>Putting his eye near the knot-hole, to his surprise he recognized the
man in the berth as Night Hawk Jerry.</p>

<p>The face of the other he did not know.</p>

<p>What he heard them say was as follows:</p>

<p>"Well, Nick, we can go and strike old Rossmore for all we can get
out of the him, after we attend to this farmer on board that I tell you
has the cash he got for a boat-load of cattle he took up to the city and
sold.</p>

<p>"He stopped at the same hotel with me, and when I told him I was
going down to see Mr. Rossmore, he told me he lived near him, and
directed me how to get there, while he said he would ask me to ride
out with him, only he had come to the village where he boarded the
boat on horseback. Now we can get a rig and drive out ahead of
the farmer, lay for him on the road, and just take in his pile, which
goes up into the thousands, I am sure.</p>

<p>"Then we can go to see old Rossmore and see what we can get out
of him, under promise of bringing him his boy."</p>

<p>"You think he'll put up anything?" asked the man addressed as
Nick.</p>

<p>"Yes, he'll put up something, though he's been very freely bled by
frauds; but, if it had not been for our being taken in by that boy Captain
Cruel picked up in New York and who was, I admit, just the
fellow if he had not played us false, we'd have got a clean fifty thousand
from Rossmore."</p>

<p>"The boy got your crib raided, you told me?"</p>

<p>"Well he did, and but for our pal who slept in the exit room, waking
up as he did, we'd have all been caught, for the boy led the police upon
us in an hour after he got away."</p>

<p>"He was a sharp one for a kid."</p>

<p>"Yes Nick he was; but you must go and turn in now, and to-morrow,
as soon as the boat lands, we'll hurry ashore and get a waggon
to head off the farmer."</p>

<p>"Good-night, Jerry."</p>

<p>"Good-night, Nick," and the latter personage left the state-room
of his fellow villain, and sought his own quarters, while Will, scarcely
having breathed as he overheard what was said, placed a pillow
against the knot-hole, and tried to go to sleep.</p>

<p>But in vain, for his brain was too full of thoughts, and it was nearly
dawn when he at last sank into a deep slumber; but he had formed a
plot in his fertile mind to thwart the two rascals in their bold game of
double robbery.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII_Headed_Off" id="CHAPTER_XVIII_Headed_Off">CHAPTER XVIII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Headed Off.</span></a></h2>

</div>
<p>FTER what he had heard, Will was most anxious to remain
unseen, for he knew that Night Hawk Jerry would recognize
him very quickly, and that would spoil all.</p>

<p>So he feigned sickness, had his breakfast brought to his state-room
the next morning, and then, as the boat landed at the town where the
two conspirators were to leave it, he grasped his gripsack and cautiously
went forward.</p>

<p>The men leaped ashore, when the gangplank was run out, and Will
followed them at considerable distance up into the village.</p>

<p>There were quite a number of passengers, so that the boy was
unable to select the one against whom the robbers had plotted.</p>

<p>But he watched his men, saw them go to a livery stable, and soon
after ride out of town at a gallop. Instantly he went to that same
stable, and a few minutes afterward was in a buggy with a driver,
going on the road which the robbers had taken, for the livery man
told him how he had directed them.</p>

<p>By fast driving he came in sight of them, and then he told his man
to draw rein and wait, while he got out and went ahead on foot.</p>

<p>By keeping close in to the woods he kept out of sight of the robber
pair, and saw them turn into a thickly-wooded point at a bend in the
road, where the underbrush was very dense.</p>

<p>"That is their ambush," he muttered to himself, and he returned
to the buggy, getting in just as a horseman appeared coming along
the road.</p>

<p>As he drew near, Will saw that he was a fine-looking man, with
an athletic form, and a kindly yet strangely stern face. He was
well dressed and appeared to be a well-to-do country gentleman,
and the boy remembered having seen him on the Chesapeake
steamboat.</p>

<p>As he drew near to where the buggy was waiting, he said pleasantly,
recognizing the negro driver: "Well, Hercules, out for a drive?"</p>

<p>"Yas, Massa Lomax, I is takin' dis young gemman on a leetle drive,
sah," answered Hercules, who had gained his name from his great
strength.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, sir, but may I have a word with you?" said Will,
politely.</p>

<p>"Certainly, young man," replied the farmer.</p>

<p>"You came down the bay on the steamer last night with me, sir."</p>

<p>"I came down on the steamer, but I do not remember to have seen
you, though your face is strangely, so <i>strangely</i> familiar to me," and
the farmer gazed fixedly into the face of the boy.</p>

<p>"We have not met, sir; but may I ask if you did not take up to
Baltimore a cargo of cattle and sell them there?"</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I overheard a plot between two men last night to rob
you on your way home this morning. My state-room adjoined theirs,
and a knot in the wooden partition had fallen out, or been pushed out,
just at my head, and I saw the men and heard their plot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>"One of the men is a noted New York crook, and I am anxious to
capture him, while his companion is doubtless a Baltimore thief."</p>

<p>"You surprise me, young sir, and I thank you most sincerely, for I
have with me a large sum of money, and taken at disadvantage
I might lose both it and my life, though I am armed."</p>

<p>"These are desperate men, sir, or at least I know one to be, and I
am determined to capture him if possible, for I can get him held until
a requisition from the Governor of New York can be obtained."</p>

<p>The farmer smiled at the words of the youth, and said: "You are
a plucky fellow, and we had better send for a constable from the
village, for Hercules will go."</p>

<p>"I am an officer, sir, and I have formed a plan to capture them,"
and Will opened his coat and showed his badge, not only to the
farmer's surprise, but to Hercules's great awe and admiration.</p>

<p>"Well, my young friend, what is your plan?"</p>

<p>"To tie my handkerchief about my face, and muffle up, laying back
in the buggy as though I was sick, while I drive by the point of ambush,
which is at the bend in the road above here.</p>

<p>"When I get by, I will leave the buggy with Hercules, and we can
get close back to the place of ambush, and you can come along, and
as the men approach you, we will be close on their tracks."</p>

<p>"A good plan, my lad; but let us know each other, as we are to act
together.</p>

<p>"My name is Kent Lomax; I am a farmer, and live not far from
here."</p>

<p>"My name is Will Raymond, sir."</p>

<p>"Raymond!" and the farmer started.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Where are you from?"</p>

<p>"New York, sir."</p>

<p>"Ah, me! Your name recalls the strange resemblance your face
bears to one I once knew, and it is strange, indeed, that face and
name should be so alike," and the farmer spoke in a voice that was
full of sadness; but in an instant he continued in a different tone:
"Well, Master Raymond, I am glad to be associated with you
in this little affair, and you are the captain, so go ahead with your
plan."</p>

<p>After a few other arrangements the boy drove on in the buggy with
Hercules, his face tied up, a scarf about his neck and his hat drawn
down over his eyes.</p>

<p>But his keen eyes were watching the road as they drove along, and
he detected in the bushes the two men in ambush.</p>

<p>As agreed upon with Kent Lomax, Hercules dropped his whip and
sprang out to get it, so that he, watching back down the road, should
know just the spot where the robbers were.</p>

<p>Then the buggy drove on, and once around the bend they turned
into a secluded spot and at once sprang out and hitched the horse,
while they crept up a ravine, which Kent Lomax had told them would
lead them almost to the bend in the road.</p>

<p>"They could not have chosen a better place for us to surprise them,"
said Will as he hurried on with the negro.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, massa, dat am so, and I awful glad I cum with you, for maybe
I git suthin' out o' dis scrimmage," returned Hercules.</p>

<p>"You shall, Hercules, and I hope it will be gold rather than lead."</p>

<p>"I don't want no lead, massa," and, Hercules picked up a stick, to
serve as a club, as they went along.</p>

<p>Soon they came to the end of the ravine, and, creeping up to the top
of the bank, Will looked over. He quickly drew back his head, for
the two men were not sixty feet from him, standing behind a clump of
bushes on the edge of the road.</p>

<p>"You see um, massa?" whispered Hercules.</p>

<p>"Yes; and Mr. Lomax is already coming, and, but a couple of
hundred yards away;" and Will took from his pocket a small revolver,
but of large calibre, and glanced at it carefully.</p>

<p>"Now I'll watch, Hercules, and you be ready to run out with me."</p>

<p>"Yas, massa."</p>

<p>In silence then they waited until, suddenly, the words were heard:</p>

<p>"Halt! Your money or your life!"</p>

<p>"Come!" and with the word Will and Hercules bounded from the
ravine.</p>

<p>They saw farmer Lomax at a halt in the road, one man grasping the
rein of his horse, and the other holding a pistol up in his face.</p>

<p>The farmer sat perfectly quiet, and the men each had an handkerchief
over his face, with holes cut to see through.</p>

<p>"Come, out with your money, and lose no time, if you value your
life!" sternly ordered Jerry, the Night Hawk.</p>

<p>The farmer thrust his hand into his pocket, drew out his well-filled
wallet, and tossed it upon the ground, just as clear and sharp came the
cry: "Hands up, Night Hawk Jerry!"</p>

<p>The two men uttered a cry of alarm and turned, to see the boy and
the negro almost upon them; and recognizing Will, Night Hawk
fired.</p>

<p>The bullet clipped a hole in Will's hat-brim, and at that moment
the boy pulled trigger, just as the robber fired a second shot.</p>

<p>Down, dropped Night Hawk, a dead man, for Will's bullet had
pierced his brain, while at the same moment Kent Lomax had hurled
himself upon the other robber and held him at his mercy.</p>

<p>"I was sorry to have to kill him, but he shot me through the hat,
for I felt it turn on my head, and his second bullet clipped my arm,
but I guess did no harm," said Will.</p>

<p>"My boy, you are worth your weight in gold; let me see if you are
hurt," and Kent Lomax turned his man over to Hercules, while he
drew off the boy's jacket and rolled up his shirt sleeve. There was
a slight gash on the left arm that was not of much consequence,
and Kent Lomax quickly bound a handkerchief about it, while he
said:</p>

<p>"You will need no requisition for your man, Master Raymond, while
this one we will give into the hands of the village constable.</p>

<p>"Hercules, mount my horse and ride back to the village for the
constable and the coroner, and I will remain here with this young
man."</p>

<p>The negro departed, while Will said: "My errand here, sir, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
to see Mr. Rossmore upon an important matter, and I am anxious
to catch the boat back to-night, so that I might drive on to his farm
and get back here by the time the constable arrives, if you do not
mind."</p>

<p>"Certainly not, and Mr. Rossmore lives on the road a mile from
here.</p>

<p>"You will come to a bridge crossing a stream with a mill upon it,
and the Rossmore place is just beyond on the hill in full view."</p>

<p>Thanking the farmer Will sprang into the buggy and drove on.</p>

<p>As he reached the bridge he came to a halt, while he said: "Why,
this is the very scene that mother painted and gave to Colonel
Ivey.</p>

<p>"How strange her painting should be so like a real scene way down
here on the eastern shore of Maryland," and, wondering at the
coincidence, Will drove on up to the handsome country home on the
hillside.</p>

<p>ITTLE dreaming that he was approaching the home of his
mother, her birth-place, and that of her mother before her, the
home from which she had fled that, to her, fatal Christmas eve,
Will Raymond drove up to the hitching-rock and sprang out of his
buggy.</p>

<p>A gentleman sat upon the piazza, smoking a cigar and reading a
paper, but arose at his approach.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, young gentleman," he said pleasantly, and then
his eyes became riveted upon Will's face. He was a man of fifty
perhaps, with noble countenance, tinged with sadness, and a look of
anxiety.</p>

<p>"My boy, who are you?" he said, quickly, before Will could
speak.</p>

<p>"Is this Mr. Rossmore?" asked Will.</p>

<p>"Yes, my son."</p>

<p>"My name is Will Raymond, sir, and I am a special officer of the
New York Secret Service, sent to see you upon a matter of interest to
you."</p>

<p>"About my lost boy? Quick! tell me if you have any news of him
whom I must say you most closely resemble, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I do resemble your son, sir, and so much so that a gang of scoundrels
were to use me as a foil to make money out of you."</p>

<p>"But you are not my boy? He would be about your age, and
look like you, I think," and Mr. Rossmore was greatly excited.</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Rossmore, I am not your son; but I have come to tell
you all I know of him, and I am sorry to say that you must give up
all hope of ever seeing him alive."</p>

<p>"No! no! no! I cannot, I cannot!" and Mr. Rossmore listened to
the whole story that Will had to tell, from his meeting with the man
who had sent him on the errand, to his killing Night Hawk by the
roadside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>"And, Mr. Rossmore," continued Will, "when I escaped from the
den of the Land Sharks, I brought with me the clothes, which they said
your boy had on when stolen, and his ring, and they were to bring
them with me, to prove that I was your Willie.</p>

<p>"I will get them," and going out to the buggy he returned with
his satchel, and the clothing and ring were exhibited.</p>

<p>"My poor, poor boy! these are indeed his little suit and ring; how
well I remember them; but, my noble boy, I must see the grave that
they say he was buried in on the prairie, before I give up all hope.
If it contains the remains of a small child, I can but believe, and
besides, Willie had his left arm broken when a baby, by falling from
the lap of his nurse, and this will identify the bones as his.</p>

<p>"Oh, may heaven's anger fall on those who murdered my little
boy!" and Mr. Rossmore bowed his head with grief, just as a lady,
whose locks were prematurely grey from sorrow and suspense, came
out upon the piazza.</p>

<p>"Husband, I have heard all, and I believe at last that our boy, our
little Willie, is dead," she said, and turning to Will, she greeted him
most kindly, while she too was struck by the likeness of the young
detective to her son.</p>

<p>"Have you parents, my boy, and a home, for gladly would I give
you one," she said to Will.</p>

<p>"Yes, my noble boy, come to us and be our son," cried Mr. Rossmore.</p>

<p>"I have a mother and sister living in New York, and I am their
only support, and I must return to them, though I thank you most
kindly for your good offer to me," said Will, touched by the grief and
generosity of Mr. Rossmore and his wife.</p>

<p>"Well, my boy, I would not rob your mother of you for worlds,
but you must let me help you, and if ever you need a friend come to
us, for we live all alone here, and are strangely restless since the loss
of my boy.</p>

<p>"We have travelled abroad, but came back soon to our Baltimore
home, and then we have come here, for this place was the home of
my wife's cousin and adopted sister, whose fate is a mystery to us,
and a sad one, for she ran away from home one night, fifteen years
ago, leaving behind her that noble man, you saved from robbery, Kent
Lomax, to whom she was engaged.</p>

<p>"She deserted him for a villain, a man whose life Kent Lomax had
saved, and she fled with the rascal to Philadelphia, and was followed
there. Kent Lomax tried to avenge the double wrong, for the poor
girl's mother died from the shock, and the villain shot him, and for
months he lay at the point of death, and, when he recovered all trace
of the man was lost.</p>

<p>"Years after her father died, and my wife here now has the estate,
which will be hers unless her adopted sister returns to claim it, or her
children do, if she has any; otherwise Mrs. Rossmore is the next
heir.</p>

<p>"So you see, wherever we go, we have sad memories to confront
us; but here both of us are well, and more content than elsewhere,
so we often come; but I am detaining you with family history, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
you are anxious to return to the scene of your affray down the road,
and I will accompany you.</p>

<p>"Wife, please send the carriage after me," and so saying Mr. Rossmore
got into the buggy with Will and drove back to where Kent
Lomax had been left with the dead man and the bound prisoner.</p>

<p>On the way Mr. Rossmore asked: "My son, do you think you
could find the grave of my little Will, from the description you had
of it?"</p>

<p>"I think so, sir."</p>

<p>"Will you go West with me and find out?"</p>

<p>"If I can get permission, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, you can telegraph what you have done to your chief, and
ask permission to go with me, and I will have my family physician
accompany us, for he set Willie's arm when it was broken, and could
tell if it was my child in the grave.</p>

<p>"But we will talk more of this, for there is farmer Lomax," and a
moment after they drove up to the spot where Kent Lomax stood,
while coming in view at the same time were a number of persons on
horseback and in buggies.</p>

<p>Hercules and the constable rode in advance, and as they rode up
and dismounted, Kent Lomax introduced Will to the officer of the
law, and his story was again told, the coroner standing near with a
jury which he had selected from the crowd.</p>

<p>All gazed upon Will as a hero; but the boy shrank from observation,
and remarked to Kent Lomax. "I hate notoriety that comes
from taking the life of a human being, villain though he was."</p>

<p>"That is the proper spirit, my lad; but the coroner wishes to ask
you a few questions, and then I would like to have you go home with
me as my guest, while I also desire to compensate you is some way
for your services to me."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir, but I am paid for my duty, and can accept no
other reward, while I am to go back with Mr. Rossmore."</p>

<p>So it was settled, and as Mr. Rossmore's carriage drove up, Will got
into it with his host, and drove away, followed by Kent Lomax on
horseback, while Hercules returned to town with the buggy and two
horses of the robbers, along with those who had come out to the
scene upon learning what had occurred.</p>

<p>That Hercules had fared well at the hands of Will, Mr. Rossmore
and Kent Lomax was evident by the happy look upon his honest face,
and the words: "I wish dere'd be a robber-killin' ebery day, and
Sunday too, and dis nigger'd get rich."</p>

<p>At a place where the roads branched off Kent Lomax bade them
good-bye, grasping Will's hand warmly, and saying: "You know my
name and address, my boy, and if you ever need a friend don't hesitate
to call on me, for I have no kindred that are dear to me and I am rich
and would be glad to serve you&mdash;so command me."</p>

<p>Thus they parted, the man who had been engaged to his mother&mdash;the
man whom she deserted to marry the man who had so cruelly
treated her.</p>

<p>Neither knew what they were to each other, and yet each seemed
drawn toward the other. Nor did Will suspect for an instant; an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
hour afterward, that he was eating dinner beneath the roof where his
mother had been born, and that Mrs. Rossmore was his own aunt.</p>

<p>That night Mr. Rossmore and Will took the boat to Baltimore,
and having sent from the village a long and explicit dispatch to Captain
Daly, an answer was found awaiting them upon their arrival at
the hotel in the city the following day.</p>

<p>The answer read:</p>

<p style="text-align: right; margin-right: 5em;">
"<span class="smcap">New York Police Dep't.</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<i>Special Officer</i>, <span class="smcap">Will Raymond</span>:&mdash;
</p>

<p>"Your telegram most satisfactory, and will get requisition for Night
Hawk's comrade and have him brought here.</p>

<p>"You have acted as I knew you would in everything, and the chief joins
me in congratulations upon your pluck and detective skill.</p>

<p>"You have full permission to go West with Mr. Rossmore, and your leave
is unlimited. Success to you.</p>

</blockquote>

<p style="text-align: right; margin-right: 5em;">
<span class="smcap">Daly.</span>"<br />
</p>

<p>That night the Westward bound through Express on the Baltimore
&amp; Ohio Railroad carried Mr. Rossmore, his family physician, and Will
Raymond, the Boy Detective, and their destination was the North
Platte river in Nebraska.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 53px;">
<a href="images/i21large.jpg"><img src="images/i21.jpg" width="53" height="70" alt="I" /></a>
</div>
<p>T was toward sunset, one pleasant afternoon, some ten days after
the visit of the Boy Detective to the eastern shore of Maryland,
that a party of horsemen were visible driving over a Nebraska
prairie.</p>

<p>The party had left Fort McPherson on the Platte, whose commander
had kindly sent an officer and soldiers, under a skilful guide, with
Mr. Rossmore, as an escort.</p>

<p>Will had told the buckskin guide just what he had heard the
Land Sharks say regarding the spot where they had buried Willie
Rossmore, and the plainsman had expressed himself as acquainted
with the Lone Tree, while he also said that there were fully a dozen
graves about it.</p>

<p>Soon the tree, standing alone on the prairie, and upon the bank of a
small stream, loomed up in the distance.</p>

<p>"There's the Lone Tree," said the guide, "and we'll reach thar jist
about dark."</p>

<p>All eyes were turned upon the distant and solitary cottonwood tree,
standing like a giant sentinel upon the prairie, and the horses were
urged on at a more rapid pace.</p>

<p>But the shadows of night fell before the tree was reached, and it
was decided to go into camp and make a search in the morning.</p>

<p>One of the pack-horses carried some pine-knots, and a fire was soon
kindled, while another carried some canvas flies which were stretched
as a shelter.</p>

<p>There were ample provisions with them, with plenty of game shot
during the day's ride, and soon a most tempting supper was spread out
before the hungry party.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>As for Will Raymond, it was to him a most enjoyable expedition,
for he had often read of a wild life upon the plains, and with the
buckskin-clad guide, the soldier escort, and the knowledge that there
was danger of an attack by Indians, he was charmed.</p>

<p>After the supper was dispatched, sentinels were placed out upon the
prairie, at some distance, the horses were staked out within the circle
formed by the four guards, and the rest of the party sought the shelter
of the tent flies to sleep. No, not all, for Mr. Rossmore was too deeply
moved by the belief that he was near the grave of his long-lost child,
and he paced to and fro, beneath the solitary tree, his thoughts busy
with his grief.</p>

<p>Then there was another that did not care to sleep, and that was
Will Raymond.</p>

<p>The surroundings, the wildness of the scene, the prairie, the
soldiers, all impressed him, and he strolled about the camp, while as
the moon arose he walked out to a sentinel on duty and had a long
talk with him.</p>

<p>At last, as midnight came, and the sentinels were relieved by others,
he went to the shelter, wrapped himself in his blanket, and soon sank
to sleep.</p>

<p>The sun was rising when he awoke, and Mr. Rossmore, who lay
near him, had just got up from his blanket couch. The guide
already had breakfast ready, and when it was over, the search for the
grave began.</p>

<p>As the guide had said there were a number of graves in the
vicinity of the tree for several trails led by it, and many a dear one,
dying upon the plains had been laid to rest there, where the solitary
cottonwood would serve as a monument to their memory.</p>

<p>"Now give me the particulars, boy pard, the time he was buried,
his age when he was put here, and I guess I kin pick out his restin'
place," said the guide.</p>

<p>Will gave the full particulars, as he knew them, and the guide set
to work.</p>

<p>Grave after grave he went to, and left, making some remark at
each one.</p>

<p>"This one looks to be about the age you say, boy pard, and it were
made as though in a hurry, and with a don't care feelin', and not as
them builds a dirt house over them they loves.</p>

<p>"Sergeant, bring yer utensils and dig earth here," said the guide,
and he stood over a small grave that indeed did look as though it
had been hastily dug and filled in, for others, even those smaller, and
evidently with the remains of children in them, were made as though
the heart of the diggers had been in the work.</p>

<p>Two soldiers now stepped forward with spades and the work was
begun of turning the earth from the grave.</p>

<p>It was not a very long task, and soon the end was reached, the
moldering bones of a body were found. Tenderly they were taken out
having been wrapped in a blanket, and from a felt hat that had been
upon the head, a mass of dark-brown curls were taken.</p>

<p>Mr. Rossmore took the hat and its precious burden tenderly, and
asked: "Doctor, this looks like Willie's hair."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, exactly the shade," was the reply, and the doctor bent over
the bones, while all present removed their hats with reverent awe, Will
Raymond having unconsciously set the example.</p>

<p>In deathlike silence all stood while the doctor placed the bones
together, and said: "This was the body of a child about
Willie's age, at the time that our young friend here says they killed
him, and it was a boy&mdash;yes, here is the left arm, and&mdash;<i>it has been
broken</i>!"</p>

<p>"Heaven have mercy! it is the body of my poor boy," groaned Mr.
Rossmore.</p>

<p>"Yes, Rossmore, it is, and I can swear to it, for here is the broken
arm, the fracture being just below the elbow, as was Willie's, while
you remember the tooth I took out for him one day?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he would not go to a dentist, but wished you to take it out,
so I sent for you."</p>

<p>"He had no other tooth missing, and none here are, you see; but
great Heaven!" and the doctor arose to his feet, holding the skull in
his hands.</p>

<p>All pressed about him, while he continued, pointing to the skull:
"Do you see that fracture?</p>

<p>"<i>It tells the story that he was murdered!</i>"</p>

<p>It was too true, the fractured skull showed where a death-blow had
been given the poor boy, but whether by accident or design, who could
tell?</p>

<p>As all crowded about the doctor, gazing at the skull, Will Raymond
sprang down into the grave and picked up something that had caught
his eye in the loose dirt.</p>

<p>"See here!" he called out, and he held up a gold watch and upon
the inside case was engraved the name:</p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Ed Ellis.</span>"<br />
</p>

<p>"Mr. Rossmore, that is the name of the man who was with Night
Hawk Jerry, whom I shot, and he was one of the kidnappers, and here
with your son, for this watch proves it, and it fell out of his pocket
when he was burying him," said Will.</p>

<p>"Boy pard, you've got a long head, for the man who laid this
boy's remains in thet grave, dropped thet watch," remarked the
guide.</p>

<p>"Then it will be a fatal evidence against him, and I will leave
nothing undone to hang him," sternly said Mr. Rossmore.</p>

<p>Then the bones were gathered together, and being placed upon one
of the pack-animals, the party started on the return to the fort.</p>

<p>Arriving there, the bones were placed in a coffin, and Mr.
Rossmore, the doctor and Will Raymond started upon their return
East, the grief-stricken father having given the guide and the
soldiers a most generous gift as an appreciation of their services.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI_Retribution_at_Last" id="CHAPTER_XXI_Retribution_at_Last">CHAPTER XXI.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Retribution at Last.</span></a></h2>

<a href="images/i22large.jpg"><img src="images/i22.jpg" width="50" height="70" alt="I" /></a>
</div>
<p>T was at Chicago that Will Raymond parted with Mr. Rossmore
and the doctor, for he was anxious to get back to New York,
as he knew his mother had not been very well when he left.</p>

<p>In vain did Mr. Rossmore urge him to accept a cheque for a large
amount for his most valuable services, for the boy was firm in his
refusal, taking only sufficient for his expenses.</p>

<p>Two boxes, one marked for Mrs. Raymond, the other for Pearl,
Mr. Rossmore also gave the youth for his mother and sister, and,
with the feeling that he had done his duty well, and would win the
praise of his chief, Will set out on his return to New York.</p>

<p>It was just supper-time, after an absence of one month, that he
knocked at the door of his home, and heard a voice say: "Come in!"</p>

<p>In he walked, and, with a cry of joy, the arms of Mrs. Raymond
were about her son, while Pearl clung to his hand in warm welcome.</p>

<p>"Oh, brother! how like a man you have grown; but you did not
lose your gold badge, did you?" cried Pearl.</p>

<p>"No, sis, I have it safe, and more, for this was a present to me,"
and he exhibited his watch and chain to the delight of his mother and
sister.</p>

<p>"And here is something for you, mother, a present from the same
kind gentleman," and when Mrs. Raymond untied a packet he gave
her, a pair of superb diamond earrings were revealed.</p>

<p>"Oh, mother!" cried Pearl.</p>

<p>"And this is for you, sis, from the same source."</p>

<p>Pearl opened her box with trembling hands, and took from a velvet
case a necklace of pearls.</p>

<p>"Mr. Rossmore was determined to pay me after all," said Will.</p>

<p>"But, my son, tell us about these superb presents," Mrs. Raymond
said.</p>

<p>"I will, mother, and it is a long, strange story," and the Boy Detective
told the story of his travels.</p>

<p>"We cannot give these presents back, can we, Will, for they ill
become Pearl and I in our poverty," said Mrs. Raymond.</p>

<p>"No, mother, for it would deeply offend good Mr. Rossmore, and
he was determined to repay me in some way; but I intend to be rich
some day, and then your presents won't be amiss; but, mother, did
you say that you knew Mr. Rossmore?"</p>

<p>"I said, Will, that I knew a gentleman once of that name," and the
woman hastily wiped away a tear.</p>

<p>"But, mother, the strangest of all, and which I forgot to tell
you, was the story he told me about his home, and how his wife's
cousin and adopted sister had treated the farmer I saved from the
robbers.</p>

<p>"And the view of his home was just like the painting you gave
Colonel Ivey, and I seemed to recognize it as soon as I saw it,
while both the farmer, Mr. Kent Lomax&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What name did you say, Will?" and Mrs. Raymond sprang
to her feet, white and trembling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>"The name of the farmer, mother, Kent Lomax," said Will, in
amazement at his mother's excitement.</p>

<p>"And you have seen that man, Kent Lomax?" again she asked,
hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Yes, mother; did you know him?"</p>

<p>Unheeding the question, she said: "Tell me of him."</p>

<p>"Well, mother, he is a tall, handsome man, with a stern face, but
a kind one, and he is a rich farmer, living near the home of Mr.
Rossmore. He was very good to me, and I felt sorry for him when
Mr. Rossmore told me he had been engaged to marry Mrs. Rossmore's
sister, a young and beautiful girl, whose home had been at the Mill
Farm.</p>

<p>"But there had come a wicked city man down there, and though
Mr. Lomax had saved his life, he had made the young lady love him
and had run off with her. It was a terrible blow, for the mother of
the young lady died of a broken heart&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Died!" groaned Mrs. Raymond, and then she said in a voice
that was hoarse and quivering: "Go on! what more did you hear,
my son?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Rossmore told me that the farmer, Kent Lomax, followed
the runaway couple to Philadelphia, and fought a duel with the
wicked man who stole his sweetheart, and received a wound that
nearly cost him his life; but since then they have never heard of Mrs.
Rossmore's sister, or her husband, for he was caught cheating at
cards soon after and driven out of the city by those who had been his
friends. But I felt so sorry for Mr. Lomax, mother, for he is such a
splendid man."</p>

<p>"And the father of this girl who so wickedly fled from her home?"
asked Mrs. Raymond in the same hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>"He died some years ago, and was buried in the family burying-ground;
but, mother, I have something else to show you, and it is
this gold watch, with a small piece of chain attached, which I found
in the grave of Willie Rossmore, and it bears the name on it of Ed.
Ellis, the man now in prison, and who was the comrade of Night
Hawk Jerry."</p>

<p>"<i>Ed. Ellis!</i> let me see the watch!" and Mrs. Raymond grasped it
from Will's hand and glanced at the name.</p>

<p>"Yes, Ed Ellis, <i>his friend</i>," she gasped, and as she did so her head
fell back, and her lips crimsoned with her life-blood.</p>

<p>"Oh, Pearl! mother has a hemorrhage! Quick! run for Doctor
Churchill!" cried Will, supporting his mother in his arms, while
his sister bounded away to fetch the physician, whom Mrs. Raymond
had been compelled to send for on several occasions.</p>

<p>Pearl soon returned, for fortunately she had met the doctor
almost at the door, and under his care the hemorrhage was stayed and
Mrs. Raymond was greatly relieved.</p>

<p>"You must keep her very quiet, and watch her carefully, for this
has been brought on by some sudden shock," said the doctor to Will,
as he departed, promising to send a faithful nurse to take care of the
poor invalid.</p>

<p>The nurse came and in the morning Mrs. Raymond appeared much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
better; but she was very pale and weak, and her face had become
haggard from suffering; but she whispered:</p>

<p>"I must live for you, my children, bitter as life is to me, and I will
do so, for you are my all in this world."</p>

<p>With a heart too full to speak Will kissed his mother and went out
to report to Captain Daly, the poor woman saying aloud as he left the
room: "My punishment is greater than I can bear, for my act, I now
know placed my poor mother in her grave, and nearly cost Kent
Lomax his life. I knew not of this duel, for <i>he</i> never told me. But
I erred, and I have suffered, and now a fearful retribution has come
upon me; but, for the sake of my children I will cling to life until
they are old enough to do without me," and closing her eyes, while
her lips moved as if in prayer, the poor woman sank into a deep
slumber.</p>

</div>
<p>HE entrance of the Boy Detective into the police precinct caused
a sensation, and his hand was grasped in welcome at every step
he took.</p>

<p>Captain Daly heard his name called and advanced to the door of his
private office to meet him, while he cried: "Welcome back, my
Wizard Will, for I received your telegram from Chicago, and you have
worked wonders."</p>

<p>"Bravo for Wizard Will!" cried a tall sergeant; while a policeman
said:</p>

<p>"The captain has well named the boy, in calling him Wizard
Will."</p>

<p>For two hours was Wizard Will, as I must now call him, closeted
with Captain Daly, and then the two came out of the private office
together.</p>

<p>A carriage was called, and they drove at once to the Tombs.
The police captain gained ready admission, and he said to the
officer in charge, after he had introduced his young <i>protege</i>: "Wizard
Will here wishes a private talk with your prisoner from Maryland,
who calls himself Ed Ellis."</p>

<p>The officer bowed assent, and Will was conducted to the cell of
Ed Ellis, the man whom he had captured in Maryland, at the time
that he had shot Night Hawk Jerry.</p>

<p>"Ho, boy, what do you want here?" gruffly said the prisoner as
Will entered and was locked in with him.</p>

<p>"I am here to have a talk with you, Ellis."</p>

<p>"What have you got to say?"</p>

<p>"I wish you to tell me if Night Hawk Jerry really killed little
Willie Rossmore, or if he died of exposure and starvation, as he
told me was the case?"</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about the kid."</p>

<p>"Did you never see him?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Suppose I tell you that I know something of your past?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't believe it."</p>

<p>"You are from Philadelphia?"</p>

<p>"Who said so?"</p>

<p>"You had a watch presented to you once."</p>

<p>"Yes, I did, and I lost it."</p>

<p>"Suppose I tell you that I know where it is?"</p>

<p>"I'll bet you don't."</p>

<p>"When did you have it last?"</p>

<p>"It was stolen from me in camp, some six years ago."</p>

<p>Will did not show the slightest sign of having seen that the man
made a slip of the tongue, as he asked:</p>

<p>"In a mining-camp, you say?"</p>

<p>"No, in a camp on the prairies."</p>

<p>"Some six years ago, in Nebraska?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Ah! you have been West, then?"</p>

<p>The man saw his mistake and recoiled, as he said:</p>

<p>"What if I have?"</p>

<p>"Suppose I tell you I know where your watch is?"</p>

<p>"Do you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I'll bet my life Night Hawk Jerry was the thief that stole it from
me, after all, and you found it on his body after you killed him."</p>

<p>"You have the chain that was attached to it?"</p>

<p>"No, I hain't."</p>

<p>"Well, this chain, taken from you in Maryland when you were captured,
is it not the same that you had on your watch?" and Will
showed a gold chain of a peculiar kind of pattern, that had been taken,
with other things, from the prisoner when he was captured.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"And you think Night Hawk Jerry stole it from you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"About six years ago?"</p>

<p>"About that."</p>

<p>"Well, tell me how you lost it."</p>

<p>"I don't know exactly, for I had it one afternoon, and when I went
to wind it up that night it was gone."</p>

<p>"This was in Nebraska?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And Jerry was with you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Who else?"</p>

<p>"We were with an emigrant train, and going out West to homestead
land."</p>

<p>"You had your own waggon and horses?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And joined the train on the march?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but we didn't stay long in company with it, as it wasn't
going our way."</p>

<p>"Did you remain long in Nebraska?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because we didn't like it there."</p>

<p>"And you returned East?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you became a Baltimore crook?"</p>

<p>"You seem to know."</p>

<p>"And Jerry became a New York crook?"</p>

<p>"As he's dead and not on trial, I may as well say that is about the
size of it."</p>

<p>"Yet you said awhile ago you had not known Jerry more than a
year?"</p>

<p>"I had forgotten."</p>

<p>"Well, Ellis, I have got your watch!"</p>

<p>"The deuce you have!"</p>

<p>"Yes; and I'll tell you where I found it."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"It had a piece of chain to it, a link of the very chain I hold here
of yours."</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember now; I had the old chain fixed over."</p>

<p>"And, Ellis, I found your watch in <i>the grave of the little boy
you murdered</i>!"</p>

<p>The man gave a cry in spite of himself, and became livid, while
Wizard Will held up the watch, all covered with dirt as it was, and
said:</p>

<p>"Here is the watch, and I took out of the grave of Willie Rossmore;
and in burying him, it rolled out of your pocket and fell there.</p>

<p>"And more, the boy's skull was crushed in by a blow you gave
him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no! Jerry gave him that blow," cried the man in quivering
tones.</p>

<p>"Jerry is not here to deny it, and you have confessed to having
been there with him, while this watch tells the story that you at
least buried him, and you and Night Hawk were the ones who kidnapped
him; so I tell you, Ellis, you are the murderer of Willie
Rossmore."</p>

<p>"If I've got to swing, boy, you'll not be there to see me die!"
was the savage threat of the man, and he sprang like a tiger at Wizard
Will.</p>

<p>But the boy stooped quickly and avoided him, while the door was
thrown open and Captain Daly sprang in and seized him, followed by
the officer in charge of the prisoner.</p>

<p>"No, my man, you can commit no more murders in the short time
you have to live, for a jury will soon send you to the gallows," said
Captain Daly, and with Wizard Will he left the cell, while the officer
of the prison remarked:</p>

<p>"We heard all he said, Wizard Will, and a stenographer took it
down, so he is doomed; and the watch insnared him, for without it
he could not have been tried for anything but highway robbery; now it
will be for murder, as well."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 55px;">
<a href="images/i24large.jpg"><img src="images/i24.jpg" width="55" height="70" alt="A" /></a>
</div>
<p>S soon as he left the cell of Ellis, the kidnapper of Willie
Rossmore, Wizard Will went directly home, for he was
anxious about his mother.</p>

<p>But he was delighted to find her much better, though weak, and
the iron will of the unfortunate woman was doing much to build her
up again, after her determination not to give up and leave her
children alone in the world.</p>

<p>"Mother, Captain Daly has increased my pay to fifty dollars a
month, so we will move to a pleasant little cottage out on Long
Island, which belongs to him, and there is no rent to pay, and it is
furnished, and has five acres of land, with a fine garden, a cow, and a
horse and buggy.</p>

<p>"Then there are plenty of flowers, and chickens, and though the
cottage has but five rooms in it, it must be a lovely place, for the
captain's brother lived there until a few days ago, when he went
West, and left it to him," and Will's enthusiastic description of the
little home got Mrs. Raymond quite excited over it, while Pearl was
wild with joy.</p>

<p>"And you say there is no rent to pay, Will?" asked his mother.</p>

<p>"The captain said he was just going to arrange with a man living
near there, to give him the use of the horse, cow and garden, to take
care of the place, while he'll give it to us if we go there to live, and
he can get me a pass on the railroad, so that will cost nothing, and it
is not half an hour's run to the station where our home is, so you
must cheer up, mother, for life is getting brighter for us."</p>

<p>"But are there any schools, my son?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mother! one only a hundred yards away, where Pearl can
go; and the captain is good enough to say I can have two hours each
day to study here in town, while he'll not put me on night work if it
can be avoided, and only on special detective service then."</p>

<p>"That is most kind of him, Will, and I must see him and thank
him."</p>

<p>"And mother," proceeded Will, whose enthusiasm increased as he
continued to enumerate, "Captain Daly says I'll have a chance to
earn special fees if I am successful in my work, so that we need not
stint ourselves in living, and I suggested an idea to him that he was
delighted with, and said I might carry it out."</p>

<p>"What was that, my son?"</p>

<p>"Well, you know that I am pretty well acquainted with New York,
and I said I would like to form a league of 'Boy Detectives,' for I
feel that I could do a great deal of good with them, and he said he
thought so too, and I should be captain."</p>

<p>"Ah! my son, I fear you are taking a very heavy weight upon your
young shoulders."</p>

<p>"I can stand it, mother."</p>

<p>"You've always said, mother, that brother had an old head on
young shoulders; but he's got broad shoulders, too, and can stand
it," Pearl remarked in her quaint way, for she would wager her life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
upon her brother being able to do anything that a man could
accomplish.</p>

<p>"Well, Will, you are the bread-winner of our home now, and the
head, young as you are, and I will not be the one to put a straw in
your way against success, for you seem to have a real talent for detective
work."</p>

<p>"Thank you, mother, and they have dubbed me, on the force,
Wizard Will, as they say I have done wonders as a Boy Detective."</p>

<p>"You have, indeed, my son, and in a few days I'll be able to move
out to the cottage, and you can then devote yourself wholly to your
new career;" and, with the firm resolve to bury her bitter past at
once, and forgetting self, to live wholly for her children, the noble,
though sorrow-haunted woman, improved steadily each day, and one
pleasant morning Captain Ryan Daly, the good-hearted officer, called
for the trio in a carriage and drove them out to the cottage, which he
playfully called Wizard Hall.</p>

<p>It was a charming little cottage, with large trees upon one side, a
lawn sloping down to an inlet of the Long Island Sound, a vegetable
garden, a stable, a meadow lot, in which an Alderney cow was grazing,
a henery, with a large number of choice fowls, and beds of flowers that
at once caught the eye of Pearl.</p>

<p>The place was in perfect condition, the garden flourishing, the house
well and completely furnished, and the store-room and cellar well
stocked, while the coal-bin and wood-shed were filled, the captain
remarking that his brother had been a most liberal provider, and
telling the story without a flush on his honest face, for he had placed
all there himself.</p>

<p>"I shall soon get well here, Captain Daly, and I know not how to
thank you for all your kindness," said Mrs. Raymond, the tears
coming into her beautiful eyes.</p>

<p>"It is a kindness for me, madam, to have the place occupied by
good tenants, and I must tell you that in yonder little cabin on the
hill lives an old negro and his wife, who will do odds and ends for
you when you need them for very small pay."</p>

<p>"Now, Wizard Will, I shall give you a week's leave to get settled
in your new home, and then you can set to work raising your League
of Boy Detectives, whom I shall put great faith in," and, promising
to come out and dine some Sunday with them, the noble-hearted
police captain&mdash;whose daily intercourse was with criminals, who was
hourly amid desperate and tragic scenes, whose will was iron, whose
nature knew no fear, but who had the heart of a woman for deeds
of kindness&mdash;took his leave and returned to the city, leaving the
mother and her children to make themselves perfectly at home in
Wizard Hall.</p>

<a href="images/i25large.jpg"><img src="images/i25.jpg" width="54" height="70" alt="A" /></a>
</div>
<p>FTER a happy week spent at his little home on the Sound,
Wizard Will returned to his duties in town.
He had made friends with the old negro and negress in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
cabin on the hill near the cottage, and had found them most willing to
do all in their power to help his mother, and had secretly made an
arrangement with them to look after matters in his absence, the old
man to look after the horse, and his wife to milk the cow.</p>

<p>He had also ingeniously attached a wire from the cottage to the
cabin, with a bell at the latter, so that his mother could call for aid
if she needed it.</p>

<p>With country air, pretty scenery, pleasant quarters, fresh milk and
vegetables, and no worry about their daily bread, Mrs. Raymond
rapidly improved in health, and life became worth the living for her, as
she strove hard to shut out the past.</p>

<p>Pearl started to school and made friends, and some kind-hearted
neighbours called upon the new-comers, so that the mother and
daughter were not wholly alone, while Wizard Will, when at home,
gave them many a pleasant drive about the country, and row or sail
upon the Sound.</p>

<p>But Will did not neglect his work in the city, and, setting to work
with energy and skill, he formed his League of Boy Detectives, and it
was but a very short while before the police force recognized their
ability and acknowledged it, treating their young captain with as
much respect as they did their own commanders.</p>

<p>In due time Ed Ellis the kidnapper and murderer was tried, found
guilty upon the testimony of Wizard Will and executed.</p>

<p>Mr. Rossmore came on to the trial, and urged Wizard Will once
more to become his adopted son, but Mrs. Raymond would not hear
of it, and also declined positively to allow her son to bring the kind-hearted
gentleman out to see her, as he wished to do.</p>

<p>Will felt hurt at this, especially as his mother gave no other reason
for her strange conduct than that she would not see any strangers.</p>

<p>With deep regret at Will's refusal to go with him Mr. Rossmore
returned to his home in Maryland, and the boy settled himself to
hard work to win greater fame in the career which he had drifted
into by accident.</p>

<p>Though he had several times seen Colonel Ivey in the street he had
avoided him, as his mother had earnestly requested him to do, and
the gallant soldier little dreamed that the name his eyes fell upon
now and then in the papers as Wizard Will, was the one whose three-dollar
gold-piece he had found on Thanksgiving morning, and still
wore as a charm upon his watch-chain, while he deeply mourned for
the woman he had learned to love, and the children who had crept
into his heart as though they were his own flesh and blood.</p>

<p>One of the first duties that the brave young officer set for himself
to accomplish with his juvenile band of Secret Service scouts was the
running to earth of the "Land Sharks," and how he accomplished
the giant task is written in the Police History of New York City,
wherein no name stands out in bolder relief than that of Wizard Will,
the Boy Ferret of New York.</p>

<p>Those who wish to know how he accomplished his task, must
